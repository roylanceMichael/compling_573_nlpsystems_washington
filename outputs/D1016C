Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
President B.J. Habibie could give Soeharto amnesty, but this could only be granted after Soeharto's accountability is completed, according to Lopa.
Meanwhile, a legislator claimed that President B.J Habibie needed no new law to start investigation on former president Soeharto, saying that the existing anti-corruption law would do.
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has been found in several provinces including land, factories and others.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
