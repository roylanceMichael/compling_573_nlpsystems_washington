Demonstrators and opposition leaders have been demanding that an investigation be conducted into whether Soeharto and his family accumulated wealth illegally while he was in power.
In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
Meanwhile, a legislator claimed that President B.J Habibie needed no new law to start investigation on former president Soeharto, saying that the existing anti-corruption law would do.
