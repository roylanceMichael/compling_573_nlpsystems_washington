JAKARTA (JP): The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro told a packed news conference here yesterday.
In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
Indonesian Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib pledged to hunt state assets which were allegedly stashed overseas during the 32-year rule of former president Soeharto, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
