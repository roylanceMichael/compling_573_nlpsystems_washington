As usual, the last line of defense against food-borne illness is consumers, who are advised to take the standard measures: thorough cooking of raw animal products, thorough washing of all food that is to be eaten raw like fruits and vegetables; keeping foods to be eaten raw separate from uncooked meats; thorough washing of hands, knives and cutting boards.
