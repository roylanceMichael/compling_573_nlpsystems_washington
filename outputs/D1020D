Two batches of Heinz baby food have been recalled in Hong Kong following a similar action in the United States over worries they may contain high levels of lead, the Health Department said Monday.
The number of people who inspect the food has remained the same.
That recall, and one in January of about 30 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meat from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in Arkansas, represent most of the increase in the pounds pulled from shelves for listeria contamination in recent years.
