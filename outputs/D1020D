At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who have purchased meat products manufactured at Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant in the last six months are being urged to return them because of concerns of possible contamination with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria.Listeria monocytogenes is not a serious threat to healthy people, causing only short-term gastrointestinal problems.Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria that healthy people usually fight off but sometimes can kill.Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18, and USDA officials said they met Bil Mar executives to urge them to consider a recall then.Although the risk of listeriosis associated with foods from deli counters is relatively low, the disease agency says pregnant women and immunosuppressed people may choose to avoid these foods or thoroughly reheat cold cuts before eating.But health officials find it especially troubling because, based on the number of reported cases, the percentage of people who die from it is much higher than from most other food-borne bacteria.Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and cold cuts.When the first reports of a food-poisoning outbreak from hot dogs and deli meats started to accumulate in state health departments across the United States last August, officials could not have guessed that the effort to contain the eruption would be so ineffective that they would still be counting victims five months later.Healthy people usually can fight off the bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms.Some Agriculture Department officials said they would like more legal authority to focus on the danger to public health when they recommend recalls, so they can warn the public faster.At the meeting, some federal officials also questioned whether they acted quickly enough in the Bil Mar recall.Aside from causing stillbirths and miscarriages, listeriosis also can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems: infants, the elderly or patients with chronic diseases, HIV infection or undergoing cancer chemotherapy.Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing four.WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent outbreaks of listeriosis are causing an immediate public health problem, federal agriculture officials said in launching a review of whether to require more testing for the deadly bacterium.For now, he and other experts, remind people to cook hot dogs and eat deli meats before the sell-by date.
