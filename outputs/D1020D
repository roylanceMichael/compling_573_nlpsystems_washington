The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18, and USDA officials said they met Bil Mar executives to urge them to consider a recall then.
In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
