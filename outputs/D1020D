The Agriculture Department announced the recall Friday night
And that recall was at the end of 1997 the only recall of that year
A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp subsidiary Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland Mich began on Dec 22
Phil Derfler a USDA deputy director suggested there should be legislation allowing the agency to require a recall based on the threat to public health rather than what it can show about the content of the food
In the Bil Mar Foods case the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company
One recall was for milk
