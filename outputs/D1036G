Dioxin causes a strong predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also affect the bodys fat metabolism
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin his doctor Michael Zimpfer said Saturday
We hadnt seen anything like that for the past 100 years Yuschenko said
Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare
The doctors Zimpfer said suspect the involvement of an external party and that the dioxin was given orall
Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September not suggestive of dioxin
Wax expressed doubts that dioxin could be used in that way
