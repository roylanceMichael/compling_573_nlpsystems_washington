EDITOR'S NOTE -- A picture of the bear is available at Internet  
site: http://www.co.boulder.co.us/da/bear.htmYet others critical of how the investigation has been handled do
not support Ramsey.Neither letter gave an opinion about the possibility of the
Ramseys' involvement in the death.The city already has spent more than $1 million in its  
investigation.The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's  
room.``They may be posturing; they may be trying to help,'' Mueller
said.
