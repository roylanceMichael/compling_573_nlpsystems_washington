Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh researchers report.Supporters of the measure say the decision could help find cures to diseases including cancer, AIDS, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease more quickly than had been expected.In the experiment, they took neurons from the striatum, the brain region hard hit by Huntington's.Both the abnormal bodies and many of the symptoms are associated with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's, the institute points out, so scientists do not know whether the ailment is a distinct disease or a variant of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, campaigned with Kerry in New Hampshire on Monday and filmed the ad after the event.But Dr. Steve Finkbeiner and colleagues at the University of California in San Francisco and the university's Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease have discovered that the mutant protein that clumps inside the brain cells of Huntington's patients actually saves cells from dying.Scientists have recently found that Lewy bodies contain a protein called alpha-synuclein, which is also linked to Parkinson's and an ailment called multiple system atrophy.Maybe you know an adult with Parkinson's disease, a brain disorder that causes shakiness and stiffness, and makes it hard to walk -- symptoms that get worse over time.Investigators studied five families with a history of Parkinson's disease who lived in the Basque region of Spain and in England.The problem is the second most frequent cause of dementia in older adults, after Alzheimer's, though it can affect younger people as well.In a lab dish, they added either the normal Huntington gene, or the mutant form that causes the disease.The investigators identified two mutations in the same gene, one associated with Parkinson's disease in the Basque families and the other which was linked to the disease in the English family.A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone dopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder Parkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An international research team, led by scientists at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), has discovered a gene which, when mutated, causes Parkinson's disease in some families.Some scientists now think the vulnerable neurons sweep the abnormal protein ``to get it out of the way,'' explained Hopkins' RossHe decided to build a microscope that would allow scientists to follow brain cells over a long period, akin to videotaping a neuron's life.
