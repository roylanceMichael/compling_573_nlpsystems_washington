Virginia Tech authorities and the police are investigating the identities of those killed as well as the gunman in the campus shooting rampage, a Virginia Tech spokeswoman told Xinhua on Monday.
A gunman opened fire in a dorm and classroom at Virginia Tech on Monday, killing at least 30 people in the deadliest shooting rampage in U.S. history, government officials told The Associated Press.
Meanwhile, CNN reported that the police is investigating the identity and the motive of the gunman.
Until Monday's shooting, the town was best-known for the university and its Blacksburg Electronic Village -- one of the oldest Internet-based community networks in the United States.
The university dominates the life in the southwestern Virginia town of Blacksburg with its population of just 40,000, and the school's 900-million dollar budget drives the local economy.
