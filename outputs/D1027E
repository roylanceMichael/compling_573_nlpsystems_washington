Joseph Rice, a clinical psychologist and jury consultant in San Francisco, cited what he said is a key difference between this case and the Jasper, Texas, dragging-death trial, in which a white man was swifly convicted and sentenced to die for dragging a black man to pieces.
In the weeks after the beating death of gay student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence and small-mindedness.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him, leaving him lashed to a fence.
