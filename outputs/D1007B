Hong Kong's neighbor city of Shenzhen has not discovered any case of H5N1 virus infection at its 200 poultry farms, according to a local official in charge of animal epidemics.
The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms, said Yu, who is on a fact-finding tour in Shenzhen.
