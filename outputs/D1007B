Hong Kong's neighbor city of Shenzhen has not discovered any case of H5N1 virus infection at its 200 poultry farms, according to a local official in charge of animal epidemics.
"The present cluster of cases detected in Hong Kong has not reached epidemic proportions," she said.
A 54-year-old succumbed to the virus early this month, but a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November.
Investigators fanned out across the territory Monday, checking poultry farms for traces of the disease amid the speculation that it could have been passed to humans by chickens.
