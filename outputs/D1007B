Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
Leung Iok Va, deputy-secretary-general of the Macao Nurses' Association, told the Macao Daily News today that there is no effective way of prevention as the cause and way of transmission of the bird flu on human beings have not been found.
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
