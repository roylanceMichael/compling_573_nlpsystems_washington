Not quite 24 hours after American cruise missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over the site Friday night.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest the attack.
El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six Tomahawk missiles.
Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail asked the United States on Friday to send a fact-finding committee to inspect the alleged chemical weapons factory in Khartoum.
