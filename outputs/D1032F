The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said.
The Snorre field is operated by Statoil, which owns a 14.39 percent share, as well as the Norwegian state-owned group Petoro, ExxonMobil of the United States, Idemitsu Petroleum of Japan, RWE Dea of Germany, Total of France, Amerada Hess of the US and Enterprise Oil of Britain.
Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself.
