The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority said Thursday.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
A Nov. 28 natural gas leak forced the shutdown of the Snorre A steel tension-leg platform and the evacuation of 180 workers.
