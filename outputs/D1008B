the packing and shipping that put Chesapeake Bay oysters on the map -- has all but collapsed.
The shell landed back in the water with a splash.
In places like Tilghman, watermen still motor up to the dock at Harrison's packing company to deliver their day's haul, just as they have for generations, and inside, shuckers still wait to crack them open in record time, as they, too, have done for generations.
I'm going to catch tourists instead.
