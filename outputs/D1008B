The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will file a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday, signaling a more aggressive strategy for a group that has grown increasingly frustrated over the slow progress in cleaning up the bay.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale.
On Tilghman Island, Harrison's Chesapeake House serves fried oyster sandwiches next to the bay (www.chesapeakehouse.com, 410-886-2121, 21551 Chesapeake House Drive).
