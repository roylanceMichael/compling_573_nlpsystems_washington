``He's been the greatest,'' his coach, Phil Jackson, said without prompting after Jordan and the Bulls won Game 7, 88-83, on Sunday night and survived the Eastern Conference finals against an opponent Jordan earlier in the series had mistakenly classified as nothing more daunting than a ``bump in the road.''
Someone in a national sports magazine commented last week that this year's Utah Jazz might actually be determined enough to force a truly competitive finals, forgetting that three of the Bulls' four victories in last year's finals were undecided until the game's final shot.
This is not to say that Jordan's Bulls haven't been pushed, haven't flirted with the sudden-death dangers of a seventh game.
Someone, usually Jordan, has made the big shot to save them the humiliation of having to squirm the way they did on Sunday night, big time in prime time.
Until Sunday night, with Jordan purifying their lineup the Bulls had not even been extended to a seventh game of a playoff series since 1992.
With many observers, this one included, believing this is Malone's and Stockton's year to get over a pretty big hump themselves.
Nine rebounds on a night when the Bulls essentially won the game with second shots.
As it turned out, the Bulls began their ascent over this bump when Jordan won a jump ball from a 7-footer.
That was when Pat Riley's New York Knicks put a second-round choke hold on Pippen, but inevitably played Game 7 at the old Chicago Stadium with an exceedingly motley crew that featured a slow-footed point guard named Mark Jackson, whose push shot often landed uglier than it took off.
Jordan once flew the way the young Ali danced, but at 35, against Larry Bird's swarming Indiana Pacers, in the fourth quarter of a seventh game, Jordan had nowhere to go but the clinches.
