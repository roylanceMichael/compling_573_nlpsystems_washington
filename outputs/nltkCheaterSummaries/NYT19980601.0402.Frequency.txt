Make sure that your child uses the right safety seat for her age and weight _ a rear-facing seat for infants up to 1 year and 20 pounds, a forward-facing seat for children over 1 year and weighing up to 40 pounds, and a booster seat for kids who are too big for a car seat and too small to fit correctly in a lap/shoulder seat belt.
&UR; SEAT BELTS &LR;  &QL;    Making sure that you and your kids wear your seat belts correctly every time you get in a car is the most effective way to prevent injury in a crash.
&QL;   &UR; -0- &QL;   &UR; CHILD-SAFETY SEATS &LR;  &QL;    All kids, especially those in car seats, are safest riding in the back.
&UR; GLOVE COMPARTMENT &LR;  &QL;    Keep your glove compartment stocked with a flashlight, a tire-pressure gauge, your owner's manual and maps of your home state and of anywhere else you may be driving.
Never place a rear-facing car seat in the front seat of a car with a passenger-side air bag.
&UR; AIR BAGS &LR;  &QL;    All new vehicles in the United States have driver-side and passenger-side air bags.
&UR; TIRES &LR;  &QL;    Some tires are made for speed, some for control and some for bad weather.
To extend the life of your tires, it's important to keep them inflated at the recommended air pressure, which can be found in the owner's manual, on a label in the glove compartment or on the driver's doorjamb.
Read the safety-seat instructions and your car manual carefully to make sure you install the seat correctly _ as many as half of all safety seats are used improperly.
&UR; BRAKES &LR;  &QL;    Antilock-braking systems prevent skids by automatically easing the brake pressure on the wheels before they lock up.
