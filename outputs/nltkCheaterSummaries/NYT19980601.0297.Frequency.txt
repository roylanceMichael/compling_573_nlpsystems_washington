``Whenever you get a lot of unwanted dogs in the area, you will see a lot of dog bites, and that is the case here in Houston,'' said Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Health and Human Services.
``It's kind of hard to see your daughter who's usually not afraid of anything now traumatized by the thought of just being outside,'' said Robert Sanchez, Vanessa's father.
``The best way to prevent dog bites is for owners to have their dogs spayed and neutered,'' Barton said.
``I want people to take care of their dogs so that I don't have to worry about getting bit and there are also a lot of kids in these neighborhoods who could be attacked.''
``I'm not usually afraid of dogs, but after this happened you might say I am terrified of them,'' he said.
``Sometimes I do not deliver people's mail until the next day because their dog is going crazy, barking and snapping at me,'' she said.
Sanchez said dog bites also can be prevented if owners take responsibility for their dogs by securely tying them up or placing them behind a fence.
``Many dog bites are from dogs that are in heat, because they are much more aggressive that way and if you do this it helps to keep the number of strays down.''
``The dog came out from under a car and I tried to kick him loose, but the neighborhood kids came and helped to get him off of my leg,'' Sanchez said.
``I hope the prevention week raises awareness in the community because this is a very important problem that needs to be solved,'' Chavez said.
