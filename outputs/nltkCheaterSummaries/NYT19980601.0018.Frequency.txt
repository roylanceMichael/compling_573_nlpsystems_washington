Asked if he would like to fight Grant, Byrd said: ``I'd have to think a lot in a fight against Mike, because if I didn't he'd run over me.''
Turner said that Grant, who had 12 fights as an amateur (11-1), had less experience than any of the other young heavyweights _ David Tua and Chris Byrd _ on Saturday night's card and even if he were to win the championship after his next two or three fights, he would still need more seasoning.
``Even though Castillo wasn't a great opponent, he was right there in front of him,'' Lou DiBella, the vice president of programming for HBO Sports, said of Byrd.
``There's no rush for me,'' Grant said of getting a title shot soon.
``I was thinking about jumping over the top rope,'' Grant said.
``When I was thinking about the move, Obed was hitting me with shots,'' Grant said.
He had knocked down Sullivan with a blistering left-right-left combination to the chin at 1:50 of the round, a right hand whistling past Sullivan's head as he was falling back to the canvas.
Tommy Brooks, Grant's co-trainer, calls him ``a work in progress.''
For all those who doubted that Michael Grant was the heir apparent to the current heavyweight champions, Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, Grant showed his best against Obed Sullivan on Saturday night at the Atlantic City Convention Center.
Turner believes that Grant is already in the same class as the top-flight heavyweights, but thinks he needs one or two more fights before he is ready for a title shot.
