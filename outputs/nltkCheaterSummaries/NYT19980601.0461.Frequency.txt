It's tempting to blame this on the limited adventurousness of the Rogaine set, the baby boomers who refuse to listen to any music, no matter how interesting or impo rtant, that's made by anyone who either (1) didn't appear at the original Woodstock (2) hasn't entered rehab at least once or (3) falls into the electronic/rap/industrial/ambient/other category (that's just so much noise, they'll complain, much as    their parents did when they heard Jimi Hendrix songs blasting from their bedroom record players).
Hearing it so many times alerted me to a question that's long troubled me:    Isn't anyone else sick of hearing the same old songs?
Sure, you may hear ``Born to    Run'' several times a week, but you won't hear anything from ``The Ghost of Tom Joad,'' Bruce Springsteen's last _ and well-received _ CD.
The days of adventuro us, college-radio-style free-form programming, when you could hear a Let's Active song, followed by a Throbbing Gristle tune, topped off with a Mission of Burma ditty (``That's When I Reach for My Revolver,'' preferably), are long gone.
``You're going to run the risk and say, `Man, how many times are you going to play that Bob Seger song?'
``A radio station that really wants to win has to play everything that's familiar and nothing that's unfamiliar.
``And my answer to that is, `As many times as people want to hear that Bob Seger song .'
I know that mainstream radio isn't where I'm likely to discover new rock songs.
With luck, maybe this will be one song I won't have to get sick of.
And to answer my earlier question, no, apparently you aren't sic k of hearing the same old songs.
