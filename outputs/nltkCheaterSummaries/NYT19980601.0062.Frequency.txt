Branham's managed-care health plan, CIGNA HealthCare of Ohio, refused to pay for the surgery, saying it was too ``experimental and investigational.''
``I have never seen any issue that provokes as much unanimous outrage as the idea that health insurance companies are turning down people's needed and covered medical care just to save a few dollars,'' Jacobson said.
The right to sue ``may actually reduce access to affordable health care coverage,'' said Mary Yost, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Hospital Association.
``It's not fair that an HMO has the last word on a decision about coverage, especially when you're talking about surgery in a life-threatening situation,'' Branham said.
``I have a lot of clients who find themselves having to devote as much time fighting the insurance company as they do fighting their illnesses, and that's a tragedy,'' Merry said.
``Right now, the same people who had a financial stake the first time coverage was denied get to decide whether to overrule themselves,'' Jacobson said.
``The mere fact that they could get sued for making bad medical decisions will maybe stop them from making those decisions.''
``They say insurance costs will go up if we do this,'' Jacobson said.
Merry said Patty Branham's surgery would have cost $80,000 to $100,000, and laws should force insurers, when looking at such high costs, to consider whether it would be more expensive to deny coverage or to pay for it.
That's an argument Merry will no doubt make during Craig Branham's trial against CIGNA, which is expected to start next month in Ross County, Ohio.
