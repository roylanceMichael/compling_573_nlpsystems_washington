In announcing the write-clearly directive, the administration's latest initiative in its ``reinventing government'' effort, Vice President Al Gore said, ``Clarity helps advance understanding, and understanding can help advance trust.
Clinton's directive also said regulations printed in the Federal Register, a daily publication that contains presidential and federal agency documents, should be rewritten by January 1999.
Clinton's write-clearly effort is the first since President Jimmy Carter urged federal agencies to simplify their documents in 1977.
Gore urged agencies to revise such documents as forms for tax payments, immigration and naturalization applications, and Social Security benefits by using active rather than passive voice, shorter sentences and everyday words.
President Clinton ordered all executive departments and agencies to issue documents in clear English and avoid wordy technical jargon that often confuses the public.
``By using plain language, we send a clear message about what the government is doing, what it requires and what services it offers,'' Clinton said in a memorandum to executive department heads.
The memo said that by this October simple language should be used in all new federal documents including letters, forms, notices and instructions distributed to the public.
They include the Veterans Affairs Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Small Business Administration.
The order also said documents created before October should be rewritten by January 2002.
But most agencies failed to comply, according to a spokesman for the Jimmy Carter Library Center in Atlanta.
