Here were the defending champions belittling the Pacers when Jordan referred to his team's loss in Game 3 as a ``bump in the road.''
And after Game 6, Jordan piped up to announce that the Bulls ``will win Game 7.''
The Pacers had a 1-point lead with 7 minutes left in the game.
We just tried to make this one game the biggest game of our season.''
Here was a dynasty led by a coach, Phil Jackson, who refused to credit the Pacers by shrugging his coat-hanger shoulders as he blamed officials for their lack of courage and ``swallowing their whistles'' in each Bulls loss.
This was not the polished Jordan, not when he made 9 of 25 shots on his way to 28 points, but there was the poise of the ultimate winner when face to face with a game that could have meant the end to the Bulls' era.
After hitting their first eight shots and taking a 13-point first-quarter lead, the Pacers learned about the resolve of the Bulls, particularly Jordan.
``I felt comfortable that this team could win a championship,'' Bird said.
``I'm sure people will say, and I've heard it asked, if the swagger is gone from the Bulls,'' Jordan said.
Davis hit his first four shots and led the Pacers on a tear that left them up by 13 in the first quarter.
