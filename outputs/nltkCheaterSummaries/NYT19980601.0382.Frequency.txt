On the morning of Jan. 21, 1989, Billy Tipton, 74, a gifted jazz musician who was a veteran of the tiny clubs and VFW posts of small-town America, collapsed on the floor of a mobile home in Spokane, Wash. Tipton's son William summoned paramedics, and as they opened Tipton's pajamas to perform resuscitation, they made an extraordinary discovery.
Ms. Middlebrook's interviews with members of Tipton's family revealed that the cross-dressing began when Dorothy tried to find a job as a jazz musician.
Billy Tipton was born Dorothy Lucille Tipton in Oklahoma City and grew up in Kansas City, Mo., a center of jazz.
At one point, she and Tipton tried to conceive a child, Ms. Cox said, but she believed she had suffered a miscarriage.
``Billy Tipton literally became a poster boy for raising consciousness about the confusion of sex (biological) and gender (culturally meaningful physical and social attributes),'' Ms. Middlebrook writes.
``Billy's story lets us watch one woman's bold solutions to gaining a certain amount of recognition in what was largely a man's world.''
In 1951, Tipton formed the Billy Tip Tipton Trio.
Tipton's life has inspired an opera, ``Billy,'' with music by Timothy Brock and a libretto by Brian Willis; a play, ``Stevie Wants to Play the Blues,'' by Eduardo Machado, and a jazz musical, ``The Slow Drag,'' by Carson Kreitzer, which was performed off-Broadway in 1996.
Ms. Oakes said she had an illness that prevented her from having a sexual relationship with Tipton.
Ms. Oakes said she felt that Tipton was not tough enough on them.
