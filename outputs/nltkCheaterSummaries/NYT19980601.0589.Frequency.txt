For example, he said, a course should have one long par-five hole _ where even the best players would have trouble reaching the green in two shots _ one ``definitely reachable'' par-five hole, and two others par-fives that would be reachable depending upon weather conditions.
In his book ``Jack Nicklaus, My Story,'' Nicklaus laid out some general guidelines for what he called a ``well-balanced golf course.''
While Muirfield may be Nicklaus' best work, his other acclaimed courses include Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario; Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Miss.
Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, the sight of the Memorial Tournament that was won by Fred Couples on Sunday, is regarded as one of the world's finest courses.
It is hard to predict what sort of course golfers should expect, because Nicklaus prides himself on variety, and the characteristics and terrain of a site go a long way toward determining what kind of course he creates.
He said he sought similar variety in the par-three holes, and added, ``Ideally, they should go in different directions to vary the wind factor.''
``The thing I take the greatest pride in as a designer is honesty _ not tricking up holes, trying to keep everything out in the open,'' Nicklaus wrote.
But building a golf course on a Bronx garbage heap should rank as one of his most creative projects.

``I don't want to play with the golfer's mind, just make him or her use it fully.''
