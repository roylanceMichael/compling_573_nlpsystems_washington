So McKeon sees the 1998 Cincinnati Reds in much the same light as the 1977 Oakland A's or the 1980 San Diego Padres.
``Sometimes you'd just like to back up the truck, load 'em up and ship 'em out,'' McKeon said.
.that team was very much like this one,'' McKeon said.
He got rid of first baseman Willie Montanez, third baseman Aurelio Rodriguez, second baseman Dave Cash, outfielder Von Joshua, infielder Fred Kendall, pitcher Bob Shirley _ all guys who had been good major-league players but were doing not much more in San Diego than enjoying an extended vacation.
LOS ANGELES _ This isn't the time for manager Jack McKeon to pull a Mount St. Helen's.
``I brought up our young players like Tim Flannery and Luis Salazar and Dave Dravecky,'' McKeon said.
Blowing his top isn't going to right what's wrong with the Cincinnati Reds.
``My objective is to make them 10 to 15 percent better as we go along,'' McKeon said.
``If they're not trying, that's different,'' he said.
And it gets you a 67-year-old manager who knows good card players can't bluff with a bad hand.
