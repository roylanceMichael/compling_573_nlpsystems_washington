Although Jones didn't have to bust a gut, she had to work to overcome Linquist's huge early lead, which was nearly two minutes at the end of the swim leg and 1:45 before the run.
Meanwhile, Michellie Jones, another Aussie, took control of the women's competition on the eight-mile run leg and coasted to her second straight Alcatraz victory with a 2:12:55 clocking, nearly a minute and a half ahead of runner-up Barb Linquist of Wilson, Wyo.
Sian Welch, Greg's wife, said the cold water affected her feet, which in turn affected her bike leg and part of the run.
When McCormack finally emerged from the Bay, he was in sixth place, nearly a half-minute behind Welch, who led the record field of 759 competitors into the 18-mile bike leg.
Welch, whom two-time champion Mike Pigg once referred to as ``a thoroughbred on the run,'' then tried to ditch McCormack, but the younger Aussie wouldn't have it and the two headed into the final 200 meters dead even.
McCormack's and Jones' victories were in the come-from-behind category, and it was the opening swim phase, a 1.5-mile trudge through the waters of San Francisco Bay, that separated the two from the other competitors.
Chris McCormack, a rookie Escapee, held off fellow Australian Greg Welch to win the swim-bike-run competition in 1 hour, 59 minutes, 56 seconds, just six seconds in front of the defending champion.
But McCormack put the hammer down, and finally caught Welch and co-leader Wes Hobson of Boulder, Colo., a couple of miles from the end of the leg.
``Barb definitely has a weak leg and that's the run,'' Jones said, seemingly oblivious to the pun.
But in a situation that nearly duplicated the 1997 event, Jones grabbed the lead at the four-mile mark of the run and coasted to her second straight Alcatraz win.
