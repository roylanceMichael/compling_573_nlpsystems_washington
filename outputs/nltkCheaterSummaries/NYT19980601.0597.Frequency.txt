One idea the ranchers quickly came up with was using ``grass banks,'' which allow r anchers low on forage to use the grass of his neighbor rather than overgraze his range.
Yeah, right, he thought, as the caller said he'd been picked to receive a ``genius grant'' of $285,000 over five years from the MacArthur Foundation f or his work forging compromises among ranchers, environmentalists and government agencies.
And the non-profit Malpai group has spent more than $400,000 to buy ``conservation easements'' on land in their area to ensure that it stays range and is not developed.
``I've also had good success on the riparian areas on my ranch,'' said McDonald, who has 350 head of cattle on the 21,000 acres he owns and leases.
McDonald said he is considering using much of the $285,000 award to buy additional conservation easements in the area, which is located east of Douglas.
Such are the problems that follow good deeds, said Sandy Eastlake, executive vice president of the Arizona Cattle Growers Association.
McDonald was recognized for his part in forming the Malpai Borderlands Group, an organization of 25 e nvironmentally aware ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico.
McDonald said the group first came together in 1992 ``to try to take care of wide open spaces and biological diversity at the same time.''
The group has worked on increasing the numbers of the threatened Chiricahuan Leopard Frog in their stock tanks and on reintroducing jaguars in the area.
They have enthusiastically backed the use of natural fires on their range for ecological cleansing; 150,000 acres have burned in recent years.
