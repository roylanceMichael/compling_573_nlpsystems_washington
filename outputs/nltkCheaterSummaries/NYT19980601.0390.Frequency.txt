I took the lead after our midmorning break, and began the last ascent alon e.    It was a special time; indescribable, really, in the feeling of solitude, and of the belief that life could be simple: just one foot in front of the other.
Trudging up Asinine Hill was the toughest, but the two of us in the back of the pack finally made it, as the other s called from a bluff where they had set up the tent.
On our first full day camping by the river, we thought a day hike was in order.
The walk back to the rim was something I'd dreaded almost from the first time I took the expedition seriously.
Our day hike toward Lava Canyon Rapids, roughly two hours northeast, was said to have some of these exposure areas.
Having a small tape recorder playing Aaron Copeland's ``Appalachian Spring'' in my earphones didn't hurt.
We would split the uphill effort in half, camping near the trail at Asinine Hill.
It started getting colder again, and we saw patches of snow as we stopped for lunch to refuel for the last push of our trek, back to the rim.
Although it might seem more logical to rest one's weary legs (whic h get the brunt of the abuse), going on a moderate excursion is a better idea.
With time, I've found that's not quite the case, but it's close.
