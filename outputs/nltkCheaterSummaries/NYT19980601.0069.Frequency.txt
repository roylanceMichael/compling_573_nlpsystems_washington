``We're going to be able to act while the meat is still out there,'' said Virginia Headley, a public health bacteriology specialist for the Texas Department of Health.
``We'll be able to put things together in a lot less time than we were before,'' said David Maserang, bureau of laboratories chief at the Texas Department of Health, the first lab to go on line.
Of the six children struck in Abilene and Greenville, all have survived, although two are still in the hospital, said Brad Walsh, regional epidemiologist for Texas Department of Health in Arlington.
Public health officials have been working to rule out a connection among the cases _ one that would point to a common food source still endangering other people.
For example, everyone who ate potato salad at the office picnic became ill. Today, with meat and produce companies distributing over large areas, contaminated food has the potential to make thousands of people sick all over the country.
The Texas Department of Health is one of 16 state labs participating in PulseNet, a computer database network linked to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta that can rapidly compare different strains of E. coli from different sources.
Public health officials say the system, which will eventually incorporate other germs, such as shigella, which causes dysentery, and a common strain of salmonella, is an important defense against the growing threat of food-borne disease.
``(PulseNet) sounds like a wonderful tool that's going to be very helpful when we do have outbreaks,'' she said.
Thanks to DNA fingerprinting technology, Walsh said, he was able to rule out a connection between the Abilene and Greenville cases early on.
Maybe cooking your meat all the way through isn't going to be enough to protect you,'' she said.
