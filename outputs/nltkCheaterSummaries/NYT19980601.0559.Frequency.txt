``It's something, in general terms, that you might consider internally,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who broached Nomo's name during a discussion about other pitchers with a reporter before Monday night's game against the Pirates.
After having his four-year major-league career take a drastic turn, Nomo might feel cozy with the Mets because Bobby Valentine managed him in Japan, pitcher Masato Yoshii is his best friend, Mike Piazza is his former catcher and Dave Wallace, a senior adviser for the Mets, was Nomo's coach with the Dodgers.
``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps all teams,'' Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said.
The Los Angeles Dodgers Monday abruptly ended their relationship with Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who helped revitalize interest in major-league baseball in 1995 with his corkscrew delivery, but this year had pitched terribly, grew disenchanted and requested a trade.
``I would like to think trades are inevitable in this business,'' Yoshii said.
The Mets expressed interest in obtaining Nomo, while the Yankees said they might also be interested in the 29-year-old right-hander, who was designated for assignment and removed from Los Angeles' 40-man roster.
``The Dodgers designated him for assignment?''
Piazza considered the prospect of the Mets' getting Nomo and said: ``That would be weird.
Nomo barely spoke during a news conference in Los Angeles, saying he ``definitely needed a change of scenery, a change of environment.''
He was 13-6 with a 2.54 ERA and 236 strikeouts in 1911/3 innings in 1995 and was named the National League's rookie of the year.
