Long Beach State's 7-4 victory over third-seeded Florida State the result of Scott Redfox's second career homer, a three-run shot that snapped a 4-4 tie earned the 49ers a rematch with No.
_ &UR;  &LR; For half a dozen innings Sunday night, Long Beach State's 49ers tried to play Snow Ball, and it wasn't getting them much.
Mike Gallo, who pitched into the seventh inning on Friday against Miami, is one of Snow's choices to start Tuesday's rematch against the Hurricanes, an elimination for both teams (Miami lost to unbeaten Arizona State, 9-2, earlier Sunday).
``He's had some big hits for us lately, he's had a hot bat,'' Snow said of Redfox, who started only a handful of games until late in the season, but has been on fire in the post-season: 12 for 31 (.387).
The 49ers tied the score with a three-run fifth, the key hit a two-run, bases-loaded single by designated hitter Mike Hota another spit in the wind by Snow, who'd started Hota just two other games all season.
``I went up trying to get a good swing and go with the pitch,'' said Redfox, who hit his only other collegiate homer two months ago against New Mexico State.
So far in their two games, the 49ers' pitching has been superb, allowing just seven runs on 14 hits over 17 innings, a far cry from everyone else here, who averaged better than 18 runs a game.
And because of it, the 49ers have a Snow Ball's chance at the 52nd College World Series after all.
Dave Snow, the 49ers' coach, had been looking for some kind of offensive charge, especially after the Dirtbags managed just four singles in their 3-1 loss to Miami in the first round.
The 49ers got one other major break, in the third inning, when Jose Zapata tried to score from third on what appeared to be a wild pitch.
