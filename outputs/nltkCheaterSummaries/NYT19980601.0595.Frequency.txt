PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The New York Mets outfielder who denied to police he was too drunk to drive in March, pleaded no contest Monday to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence.
``The point I want to make, yes, I did make a mistake, and the mistake probably, most definitely, was driving after having a couple of beers,'' Gilkey said at the time.
On March 3 Port St. Lucie, Fla. police pulled over Gilkey's leased 1998 Cadillac at 1:30 a.m. _ half an hour past his curfew.
Police said the ballplayer was driving westbound at about 55 mph on Port St. Lucie Boulevard, where the limit is 40 mph.
Addressing reporters soon after his arrest, Gilkey said he'd had ``a couple of beers'' on his way home but denied his driving was impaired.
Kibbey said his client decided to plea no contest to the charges because there was no videotape of his arrest, meaning the case would boil down to his word against that of the two police officers.
Mike Maycen wrote in his report that Gilkey smelled like alcohol and ``seemed to be confused'' when Maycen pulled him over.
St. Lucie County Judge Dan Vaughn sentenced Bernard Gilkey, 31, to a year of probation and 50 hours of community service.
``He's having a phenomenal season right now,'' Kibbey said.
His license was suspended for six months and he must attend DUI classes and pay $250 plus court costs.
