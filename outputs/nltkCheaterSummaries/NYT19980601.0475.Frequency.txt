``If I were giving the award, he'd be my first choice,'' said Levine, now living in Fresno, Calif. ``He's enormously deserving, a brilliant man, and very serious in terms of his commitment to poetry.''
HOUSTON _ In April, when transplanted Houston poet Edward Hirsch won a prestigious award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an aunt in Chicago wondered aloud, ``When are you going to win a prize the family has heard of?''
Hirsch can't forget the day Gabriel turned to him and said, ``We're poets, aren't we, Dad?''
``He's an exemplary artist _ I can't think of anyone more deserving,'' Conarroe said.
``I was stunned, I'm still stunned, I don't know what to think,'' Hirsch said.
At present Hirsch teaches one semester a year at UH, writes a column for the American Poetry Review, serves as poetry editor for the literary magazine, DoubleTake, and tries to concentrate on his own poetry.
``He's so skillful and honest and tactful and gentle, yet there's no B.S.''
When poet Philip Levine got word of Hirsch's prize Monday, he cheered.
``Everybody in my family is wildly excited,'' Hirsch laughed Monday.
Hirsch, also a professor in the creative writing program at the University of Houston, was on the list.
