NEW YORK _ Ernest Bloch, an authority on corporate finance who taught at New York University and wrote widely on economic and financial affairs, died on May 15 in Tisch Hospital at NYU Medical Center.
He received his Ph.D. at the New School for Social Research in 1962 while working as a research economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The author of many articles on those subjects, he was named the Charles Gerstenberg professor of finance at the Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966 and became chairman of the finance department in the late 1970s.
Bloch was a consultant to many private corporations and the Bank of Japan, and organized an NYU program to train investment banking executives for Deutsche Bank.
He emigrated to the United States in 1939 and was a staff sergeant in the 10th Armored Division, interrogating German prisoners of war as Gen. George Patton's 3rd Army fought its way across France and Germany.
Bloch joined the NYU faculty that year to teach corporate finance, monetary policy and money and banking.
Bloch wrote a classic work in his field, ``Inside Investment Banking,'' in 1986 (Irwin).
He retired from NYU in 1991 but continued to teach there part time until four years ago.
Bloch is survived by his wife of 52 years, Amy Weiss Bloch, of Heritage Hills, and a son, Geoffrey, of Manhattan.
Bloch, a former resident of lower Manhattan, was 77 and lived at Heritage Hills in Somers, N.Y.
