Therefore, Netanyahu has to choose: Go with the United States and Palestinians, and advance the process but lose part of his coalition, or hold his whole coalition and lose the process.
Consider the context of Gingrich's Israel trip: Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has presented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a fair-minded plan for satisfying Israel's security needs and the Palestinians' territorial requests, and to move the process into final-status talks.
Then, while in Israel, he signals Netanyahu that if he decides to go with his hard-liners and reject the U.S. plan _ no problem: Newt will make sure Bibi suffers no penalty in Washington.
And Jordan is terrified that Netanyahu is going to reject the U.S. plan and make it impossible for Jordan to sustain its relationship with Israel.
If the Clinton team has the courage to tell it like it is, and keep the pressure on Netanyahu, he will eventually accept the U.S. plan.
When the White House warned him this could trigger an explosion, he backed off, but he did declare Jerusalem ``the united and eternal capital of Israel'' _ in contravention of U.S. policy that Jerusalem's final status should be negotiated by the parties.
Though the U.S. plan protects Israel's security needs, it does not satisfy every fantasy of every extremist in Bibi's Cabinet.
So Netanyahu keeps delaying and trying to squeeze even more out of the Americans and Palestinians, hoping for a deal that would be so overwhelmingly in Israel's favor that Sharon's complaints would be neutralized.
I hope Jerusalem stays Israel's eternal capital too, but to rub this in the face of Palestinians when the United States is trying to persuade them to accept other compromises is stupid.
But Gingrich's pathetic performance was typical of this moment, when the illusion is widespread that the peace process is just about domestic U.S. politics, and who can mobilize Congress and the Jews the best.
