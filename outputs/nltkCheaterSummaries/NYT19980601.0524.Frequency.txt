Sales have slowly picked up since Thralls redesigned the site a year and a half ago, turning it from a simple home page with two photos into an extensive site with dozens of pages and hundreds of links to related sites.
She said she plans to register other search words such as ``hippie'' and ``counterculture.''
Billyblue.com, which offers 120 items, has gone through three redesigns since a simple home page launch in 1995 on the Virtual Village &UR;  &LR; ``shopping mall,'' a Web site that hosts a lot of retail sites.
Billy Blue, a San Francisco men's clothier, provides a more optimistic model for cyber retailers: While its total online sales have been relatively small, the site has sold more upscale apparel in the past two months than Saks did in its 18 months on the Web.
``Saks will come back when they realize they made a mistake,'' says Billy Bragman, owner of Billy Blue.
``Tiedye.com'' and ``Tiedyed.com'' were already taken when she applied for a name three years ago.
``Ultimately there's so much earning potential that even if I lose a couple of grand now (on mistakes), it's worth it,'' he said.
``The site has paid for itself 10 times over,'' Thralls said.
``The business we've done far outweighs the costs we've put into it,'' said Dashiell.
During the winter, Web sales can account for 20 percent of the company's total revenues, said Tara Thralls, who owns the business and runs it with her two daughters, Star and Patty.
