Two great recent examples are the incongruous rantings of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as he spews his double-speak bile about the Middle East _ a breach of U.S. political ethics _ and last weekend's so-called response to President Clinton's Saturday radio address.
What made Bond's response so distasteful to me was that for all the years (12) of the Reagan and Bush administrations, whatever attention they gave to their highly publicized war on drugs met with failure.
That this was a ``response'' and that Clinton's Saturday talk had nothing to do with illegal drugs and everything to do with prayer in the schools only documents that these responses are not responses at all but planned political strikes.
On the eve of his trip to the Middle East, Gingrich began promoting his own foreign policy, squarely on the side of the Israelis and castigating Secretary of State Madeline Albright for, he said, being on the side of the Palestinians.
Somewhere between the radicalism of both sides sit the American people, being lied to and deceived year after year, confused by distorted accusations often fostered by paid political lobbyists who really run the country.
The Atlanta Constitution, in an editorial, briskly reminded Motor Mouth of a 1984 article he wrote for the newspaper that condemned legislative meddling in U.S. foreign policy.
Bond, in his response that wasn't, laid a lot of the blame of violent crime on young kids using drugs.
While the nation remained a dumping ground for illegal drugs, Martinez's office became a dumping ground for people with friends in high places.
At the time, Gingrich was being critical of 10 congressmen who wrote a letter to Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega criticizing the Reagan administration for its policy toward Nicaragua.
used his time to assault the Clinton administration for turning ``a blind eye to the evils of illegal drugs.''
