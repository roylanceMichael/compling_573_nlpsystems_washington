Until May 22, the Mets were a sound though boring team, a team that could win with pitching and defense but whose pitchers couldn't afford to give up more than a run or two because they couldn't count on the hitters to produce more.
The Mets will obviously not maintain the level of play that has caught the attention of the Yankees and demanded the attention of the fans and the news media, which had buried the Mets under their blanket coverage of the Yankees' torrid start.
NEW YORK _ It won't be long before the inter-league series between the Mets and the Yankees will be billed as a World Series preview.
``Don't count them out; that's the way I look at it,'' the Yankees' Darryl Strawberry said Monday, discussing the Mets' rapid rise in the National League East.
``I think it's great,'' said the Yankees' David Cone, like Strawberry a refugee from that other team.
Having slashed Atlanta's lead from nine games to five in the first seven games after The Trade, the Mets have not only raised their position in the NL wild-card race, but also have some dreamers thinking they could be good enough to overtake the perennial champion Braves.
The developments in Queens have made the team in the Bronx take notice, although news of those developments doesn't appear to have reached City Hall and the Yankees' self-proclaimed No.
Strawberry said the addition of a player like Piazza builds confidence throughout the clubhouse.
When you have a guy like that come in, it makes other players raise their ability to play the game because they know this guy comes to play.
``Some teams in the thick of things don't ever add or do anything,'' the Yankees' Paul O'Neill said.
