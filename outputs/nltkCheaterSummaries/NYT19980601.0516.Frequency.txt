This is not the same Jazz team that was at first awestruck before stretching Chicago to six games in last year's National Basketball Association finals.
``Indiana gave us all we could handle,'' Pippen said moments after the Bulls grabbed Game 7 from the Pacers at the United Center on Sunday.
But if the Bulls can rise above their weariness, if they can take a game at the Delta Center and swipe the home-court advantage from the Jazz, this could go down as the greatest achievement of their supreme era.
Last year, a sour slice of pizza left Jordan as green as a surgeon's gown, although he was able to work his magic at the Delta Center and suck the life out of the Jazz in Game 5.
``Chicago can steal one of those first two games,'' Indiana Coach Larry Bird said.
``We're tired, but out heart isn't tired,'' Jordan said.
``For a team that's trying to win for the third time in a row, it's not uncommon to fight yourself.
There will be excitement, but uncertainty as they plant themselves on the Delta Center floor in Salt Lake City for Game 1 Wednesday in a land that might as well be another planet this year.
They still have Michael Jordan, but the Jazz holds the home-court advantage.
But the Jazz won the tie breaker and secured home-court advantage throughout the playoffs because they swept the Bulls this season, the only team to do so.
