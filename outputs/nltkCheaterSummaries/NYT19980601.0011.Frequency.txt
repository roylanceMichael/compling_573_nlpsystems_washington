``There are some commissions that are putrid, terrible,'' said Mike Boorman, a spokesman for Main Events, a large boxing promoter based in Totowa, N.J. ``If you did a bell curve, New York would get an A.''
``The commission has always been a dumping ground,'' said one former senior New York boxing regulator, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But spending on supplies, materials, medical testing, travel and equipment purchases grew as well, according to commission budget documents.
A spokesman for the commission, Scott Trent, said most of the spending increases were due to staff salaries being restored to their former levels.
Clumps of men in sport coats with badges and New York State Athletic Commission emblems guarded the dressing-room doors.
Over the years, the state athletic commission has been criticized as a political patronage operation.
Still, when compared with other states, New York clearly requires more medical screening of fighters and operates with a budget that dwarfs those elsewhere.
In 1992, for example, the commission spent $494,800 to regulate 31 boxing shows.
The state requires each fighter to get a CAT brain scan, as well as an electrocardiogram and an EKG once a year.
The commission's budget, which was seriously cut during the economic recession in New York in the early 1990s, has ballooned since, despite no growth in the number of events.
