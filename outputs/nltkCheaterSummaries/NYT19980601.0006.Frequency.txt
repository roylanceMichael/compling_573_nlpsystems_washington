``For as long as anybody kept track of the school calendar, the Jewish holidays have always been observed here in Perth Amboy,'' said Norm Tankiewicz, the district representative for the Perth Amboy Federation/AFT, the teachers' union.
Jack Roedecker, the assistant superintendent in Perth Amboy, said his district did not want to start before Labor Day and so to gain extra days decided to not close for two Jewish holidays.
In Norwalk, Conn., school will start Sept. 1, a bit later than surrounding school districts, but before Labor Day, when many families are still enjoying the last of their summer vacations.
In New York City, where the teachers' contract says school cannot start before Labor Day, classes will also begin Sept. 9.
In Perth Amboy, N.J., school officials opted to convene classes on Sept. 9, but to do away with vacation days for two Jewish holidays.
For Nancy Powers, a sales director for a medical company in Bucks County, Pa., the decision by the Pennsbury School District to start school before Labor Day almost ruined her family's vacation.
``If we had started before Labor Day, we would have had a lot of absences,'' said Irene Cruikshank, president of the Council of South Huntington PTA's.
``Every time we try something that impinges or infringes on that traditional summer family vacation, it becomes controversial,'' said Orville Ballard, a regional liaison to the State Commissioner of Education in Texas.
In Kansas City, Mo., classes convene Sept. 1, the first time school has started before Labor Day.
As officials everywhere are realizing this year, any tinkering with the first day of school affects every other holiday or day off throughout the year.
