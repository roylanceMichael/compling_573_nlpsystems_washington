Once described as the ``Energizer bunny'' of California politics, the methodical and phlegmatic Davis seemed like just another political has-been after Harman and Checchi got up to speed.
``This is just an unprecedented race that will be analyzed for years to come,'' said Darry Sragow, an adviser to Al Checchi, the former Northwest Airlines co-chairman who faces fellow Democrats Gray and Rep. Jane Harman in the primary race for governor.
Checchi now blames himself for being stereotyped as the rich candidate, but he was the one who spent more money on a primary than anyone else in the history of state politics _ at least $30 million, most on it on dozens of television commercials.
An Orange County Register columnist seemed to hit the mark when he suggested several months ago, when Davis was behind in the polls, that people look at who Californians have elected governor since Jerry Brown left office in 1983.
``I don't think we've seen this many heavy hitters in one race before,'' said Mark Petracca, chairman of the Political Science Department at the University of California at Irvine.
Checchi's biggest problem now is that people overwhelmingly dislike the image he presented on television, but they seem to adore him on the campaign trail where he can meet only a few people at a time.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The 1998 primary campaign for California governor has shown more clearly than ever that two things are inevitable in America: excess and television.
``A year ago, the Checchi campaign was saying they would spend whatever it took to get the job done,'' said Roy Behr, a campaign consultant to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and former adviser to Harman.
``People like Gray Davis and Dan Lungren, who have run in several statewide campaigns, are known to the public,'' Deukmejian said.
&QL;     &QL;    The open primary has been called a test run of the November election, since people aren't restricted to voting within their party.
