``People in nonprofits are becoming willing to ask the harder questions and do longer-range thinking about technology,'' said Daniel Ben-Horin, executive director of CompuMentor, a San Francisco group that helps nonprofits take advantage of computers.
``If you weigh creating a computer database against providing food, shelter and language services to our clients, our priority will be for basic needs,'' said Beckie Masaki, director of the Asian Women's Shelter.
``Sometimes, a group will have a dentist on their board who says, `I know a great programmer,''' said Jan Masaoka, executive director of the Support Center for Nonprofit Management in San Francisco.
``Right now, we're debating whether we need to go out and invest in a new computer or wait 'till a fairy godmother comes by and says, `Here's a Pentium''' said Chavis.
``If there's a fairy godmother or godfather out there who can help us with technology, please tell us,'' pleaded Velma Chavis, a volunteer and secretary for the Oakland group.
``We are on the cusp of a turnaround where in the next two or three years, we'll see nonprofits up there using technology like everyone else,'' said Florence Green, executive director of the 1,800-member California Association of Nonprofits.
``You end up with far too many organizations that have the equipment they need but no capability of using it beyond the first or low-second gears,'' Ben-Horin said.
``That means a tremendous productivity loss and tremendous frustration, with people sitting there every day staring at a computer that isn't doing what they want.''
``I'm talking about an informed choice to stay, perhaps, a bit behind the cutting edge while reserving funds for planning, training and support,'' he said.
``We're trying to get away from handouts because there comes a time when that doesn't work anymore.''
