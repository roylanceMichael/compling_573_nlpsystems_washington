The real trouble, now as for 30-40 years past, in Nicaragua and Honduras alike, is not weather but people: big ranchers clearing land for cattle, slash-and-burn peasant farmers, timber companies logging indiscriminately and often illegally: ``They get permission for 50 trees and take 500,'' says one angry conservationist.
In Nicaragua alone, a British-aided monitoring program using satellite images has counted many thousands of fires, especially on the Caribbean side, whose forests, stretching across into Honduras, are the last really large area of pristine forest in Central America.
Timber companies have played their part; a Korean one has been accused not only of cutting into precious hardwood forests around and in the Bosawas reserve on the Caribbean coast, but of opening trails into the forest for settlers like the ex-Contras.

Siegfried Kasl, a technical adviser to a German project in Nicaragua's Bosawas reserve _ named a UNESCO ``biosphere'' reserve only in February _ says that it will need military protection: otherwise, ``after the vegetation is destroyed, peasants will invade.''

Water is being taken by tanker around San Pedro Sula, the country's commercial capital, as it is in the Nicaraguan highland city of Matagalpa.
Leave the last word to Nicaragua's La Prensa, not a famously radical newspaper: ``Desolation and destruction are everywhere; if nothing is done Nicaraguans will be without flora, fauna or food.''
Honduras reported a continuing sharp rise in respiratory disorders, and until Monday the country's four main airports had all been closed for some days for lack of visibility.
