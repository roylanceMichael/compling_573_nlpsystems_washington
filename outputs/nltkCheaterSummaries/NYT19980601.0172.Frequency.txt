Paramount Pictures began early press and sneak screenings of ``The Truman Show'' months ago, hoping to get out the word that this was not another slapstick Carrey movie along the lines of ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' or ``Dumb and Dumber.''
``They (Paramount) have done enough testing to know there's a drop-off of those who are maybe too young (to appreciate ``The Truman Show'') or just want to see him slip on a banana skin,'' Weir says.
Since ``The Cable Guy,'' Carrey has apparently expanded his fan base with ``Liar Liar,'' which appealed to a more mature audience than ``Ace Ventura.''
``The very same people who go, `I just want to see him do this one thing,' if you did that one thing five times in a row, they're over you,'' Carrey says.
``It's just a shooting gallery sometimes,'' Carrey says.
But that's no guarantee ``The Truman Show'' will succeed.
``The Truman Show was one of the best scripts I'd ever read,'' he says.
Paramount was also testing the waters to find out how to market its unusual film, mindful of the relative disaster that occurred when Carrey first tried a satire, the dark ``The Cable Guy.''
(Carrey got an unprecedented $20 million to star in ``The Cable Guy.'')
Esquire ran an advance story calling The Truman Show ``the movie of the decade.''
