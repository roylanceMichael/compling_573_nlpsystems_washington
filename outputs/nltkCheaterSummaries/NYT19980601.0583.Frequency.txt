``Sure, it's a great team we're about to play against, but when you talk about a team (the Bulls) that has won so much, achieved so much, and an organization that has won so much, a lot of times it's a battle against yourself.
The Bulls and Michael Jordan will be gunning for their sixth NBA championship in the '90s when they take on the Jazz in the championship series starting Wednesday night at the Delta Center, a rematch of last year's NBA Finals won by Chicago in six games.
That's not much time for the Bulls to recover from their physically demanding battle in the Eastern Conference finals, in which they edged Indiana 88-83 in Game 7 on Sunday at the United Center.
Utah also won 62 games but swept the two meetings with the Bulls during the regular season, giving the Jazz the home-court advantage in the Finals.
``Chicago has an excellent chance of going out there and stealing one of the first two games,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird.
If we're fatigued and can't get up and down in transition, it's going to hurt us.''
``You look back over the season at some of the games you should have won, and it comes back to haunt you,'' the Bulls forward said.
But then again, we're going to be playing hard, and we're going to battle tougher, because that's what happens when you play all the time.
``We're going to have two days off, and that's not a lot of time.
``When a team is trying to do something for the third time, it's not uncommon to lose focus at certain times,'' Jordan said.
