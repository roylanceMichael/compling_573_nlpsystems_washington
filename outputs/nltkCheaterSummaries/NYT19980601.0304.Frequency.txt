Garden, who identified himself as a private detective, reached into a tan briefcase and pulled out legal documents that he said ``dealt with personal matters'' involving Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
About two weeks before Tower went to the FBI, his office received a series of phone calls from a New York man who identified himself as Robert Garden.
About a month before Tower's call, the FBI investigated reports that another New York private detective had tried to sell similar documents to union leader James Hoffa.
Muckraking journalist Seymour Hersh also dismisses the allegations in his new book, ``The Dark Side of Camelot,'' an otherwise scathing account of Kennedy's personal life.
Garden said he had information regarding the ``national welfare'' that he wanted to pass on to the Republican senator.
WASHINGTON _ Of all the strange items in the recently released FBI files on former President John F. Kennedy, one of the strangest is a cloak-and-dagger tale involving former Sen. John Tower of Texas.
The brief conversation persuaded Tower to send administrative assistant H. Edward Munden to meet the mysterious tipster at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
``The gist of the matter appeared to concern an affair between the president and a woman and as a result of which the woman became pregnant,'' the FBI summary states.
The meeting ended when Munden told the tipster that he ``wanted nothing to do with such material.''
``Garden claimed to have compromising pictures and additional documents in safe deposit boxes in the midwest and west coast.''
