The fighting now, however, is different with elite special police and military units moving to wipe out rebel enclaves along the border with Albania and in the central Drenica region, according to witnesses in Pristina reached by telephone.
BELGRADE, Serbia _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has started a sweeping campaign to wipe out a separatist rebel movement in the Serbian province in Kosovo, senior NATO officials and Western diplomats say.
But NATO officials conceded that it could take up to 20,000 soldiers to police the border with Albania and doubted that it would be possible to find the support necessary to deploy such a large contingent.
Without such a force many fear that the Serbs will cross into the lawless region in northeastern Albania in pursuit of the rebels, perhaps drawing Albania into the war.
The Serbian government, which agreed last month to hold talks with the ethnic Albanians in order to stave off sanctions, said it would meet for a second time with the Kosovo Albanian leaders on June 5.
More than 200 people have been killed since March, including three Yugoslav soldiers gunned down at the Morina border post near northern Albania on Friday.
Phone lines and roads to the areas under attack are cut, but reports are filtering out of numerous dead, not only ethnic Albanians but also Serbian civilians, police officers and soldiers.
``NATO is watching the evolving situation in Kosovo with increasing concern as the conflict there has intensified,'' said Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe, in an interview at NATO headquarters in Belgium on Friday.
The Serbian police confirmed Monday that they were engaged in heavy combat and had ``liquidated several dozen terrorists'' in the central Drenica region.
Many villages are burning, especially those near the Albanian border, witnesses said in telephone interviews Monday.
