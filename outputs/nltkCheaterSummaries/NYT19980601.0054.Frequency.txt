``That's why he's the best player in the league, and why he's probably the best player ever,'' said a downcast Bird, who came up one win short of leading the Pacers to their first NBA Finals in his first year as a coach.
But most of all, they needed Jordan, who had only played in one Game 7 during the championship years (in 1992, when the Bulls defeated New York in the second round).
Travis Best, one of Game 6's heroes, was invisible with four points and one assist.
The Bulls, faced with playoff elimination for one of the very few times since they began their string of titles in 1991, needed every jumper, every loose ball, every defensive stop and every whistle in their favor to hold off the Pacers before an alternately tense and raucous United Center crowd.
Jordan shot &LR; ju  &LR; 9-for-25 from the floor and 10-for-15 from the line, but he also grabbed two crucial rebounds in the final two minutes.
The first was after Scottie Pippen missed a free throw after a basket that gave the Bulls an 87-83 lead, and the second came with 17 seconds left and the score the same, after the Pacers' Derrick McKey missed a desperate 3-pointer.
It was a sloppy game on both sides: the two teams combined to miss 33 of 78 free throws, and the Bulls' 38 percent shooting was negated by the Pacers' 13 turnovers, five in the final period.
``We did get the effort but we got beat to a lot of loose balls, a lot of rebounds slipped out of our hands _ a lot of little things beat us,'' Bird said.
But they managed only one basket the rest of the way, and in one gruesome stretch of four possessions they turned the ball over three times.
The Bulls on Sunday night won the seventh and deciding game of the Eastern Conference finals 88-83, and finally moved on to play the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals that open in Salt Lake City on Wednesday.
