And as if a huge weight had been lifted from their collective shoulders, the mood at Sunday's practice was light, despite a discouraging 2-0 loss to the Capitals on Saturday night at Marine Midland Arena, a loss which put the Sabres down 3-1, a game away from elimination from the NHL playoffs.
There is no one outside of the Sabres' locker room, not even the fans in Buffalo, according to coach Lindy Ruff, who expect the Sabres to come back against the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals.
Even Dominik Hasek, the Sabres goalie, who allowed a 70-footer into his goal on Saturday and subsequently took the brunt of the blame for the loss, was wearing a smile Sunday.
Another sign on the back of Hasek's jersey read, ``Swiss cheese,'' as in what Hasek resembled after allowing the Capitals' Joe Juneau to score from behind the blue line.
And the Sabres know they are only one Hasek hot streak way from pulling to within one game of Washington.
``We wanted to have fun today,'' said Hasek, who has allowed nine goals in the last three games.
The feeling in the Sabres' locker room was that the pressure has now shifted to the Capitals, who were the higher-seeded team and are haunted by their long history of failure in the playoffs.
On the goalie's back was written ``Kramer,'' as in the character from ``Seinfeld'' who Hasek resembles so much, but who also dislikes it when teased by his teammates.
``We know that,'' said Matthew Barnaby, who upset the Capitals with his taunts and post-goal celebration in Game 2 at the MCI Center.
Hasek carried the Sabres during the regular season and in the early rounds of the playoffs, but has been criticized in the past for not playing well when the stakes are raised.
