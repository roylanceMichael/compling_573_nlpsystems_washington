First surprise: If you already have Microsoft Office 97, you may first need to install the Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch, also known as SR-1.
The clue: When you run a repaired version and click the ``About'' item under the Help menu, the rubric ``SR-1'' will appear after the program's name.
SR-1 also repairs one of my all-time favorite demonstrations of Microsoft's emphasis on quality, the Outlook calendar that put Thanksgiving on various Tuesdays and Wednesdays over the next few years, but never on Thursday, not even in the year 2000.
If for some reason you need to reinstall Office 97 or one of its programs, you will need to run the patch again.
On my machine, which already had Outlook 97 and Internet Explorer 3 installed, the ``standard'' installation grabbed 54 megabytes of disk space for itself despite omitting some potentially useful optional components.
Since the SR-1 fixes must be in place before you can use a forthcoming SR-2 patch, which includes another hunk of code that repairs potential errors in Excel's spreadsheets, installing SR-1 is a good idea.
You can get along with Outlook 98 if you are willing to work at it, but most users are likely to be more comfortable with simpler E-mail software like Outlook Express and personal information managers like Sidekick or the software that comes with the Palm computer.
Worse, if you need to install a smaller component, you will need to uninstall Office in its entirety, reinstall it, and then run the patch program.
When I finally got to install the thing, a dispiriting message warned that ``the patch can take up to 45 minutes to finish depending on your hardware,'' but on a fast new machine it took only 5.
Well, it can do all sorts of things you may have never even considered, like turning an electronic message into a calendar entry or a to-do item simply by dragging it from one place to another.
