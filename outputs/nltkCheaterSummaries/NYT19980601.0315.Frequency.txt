They were wine guys, but they were also Warriors season-ticket holders, and they thought, hey, wouldn't it be a blast to meet the coaches and do a little wine promoting at the same time.
``When are we going wine tasting?''
In fact, it's called a ``thief,'' and it scooped up 1997 Barricia Vineyard Chardonnay from an old cask and then from a new cask.

So Gustafson and Kenton, who've since moved to Codorniu Napa, sent St. Jean some wine and invited him and M.J. to the winery, and pretty soon they all became friends.
The chardonnay was really terrific, especially when you consider that Ravenswood is a red wine house, well-known for zinfandel.
