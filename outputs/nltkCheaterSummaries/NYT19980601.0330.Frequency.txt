Spend time with Stephen Fry, and it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Oscar Wilde, which Fry does magnificently in ``Wilde,'' a new film biography opening Friday.
&QL;  (end poetry style) &QL;   &QL;    Still, since there is no video of Wilde, Fry was not bound by tried-and-true representations of Wilde's speech patterns or gestures.
&QL;   &QL;  Love of Wilde    &QL;   &QL;    Fry discovered the author as a child, recalling his eventual reverence for him like ``a slow falling in love rather than an explosive one.
Mitchell's screenplay is based on the Richard Ellmann biography, and while there have been other films about Wilde, Gilbert feels his is the first to deal in detail _ some would say, explicitly _ with the all-consuming doomed love affair which wound up costing Wilde everything from his reputation to his children whom he never saw again after his imprisonment.
&QL;   &QL;  Film has its critics    &QL;   &QL;    Still, the film, which has received positive notices in New York and Los Angeles, has not been embraced by everyone.
Then as a teenager I fell in love with his image in quite the shallow way that teenagers do,'' said Fry, who like Wilde, is gay.
Even Dorothy Parker, amply and able in any battle of wits, once said:    &QL;  (begin poetry style) &QL;   &QL;    If, with the literate, I am    Impelled to try an epigram    I never seem to take the credit    We all assume that Oscar said it.
``In history I don't think there's ever been a film which has been liked by the family, and it'll never happen,'' Fry said.
Several film adaptations of Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' his play about a politician embroiled in scandal, are chugging their way through the Hollywood pipeline.
``The terrible tragedy of it, and the irony is that 100 years on, he's changed from being one of the most loathed and comtemptible of human beings, to someone who in some ways is a beacon to a lot of people,'' said Gilbert, who also directed the film ``Tom and Viv.''
