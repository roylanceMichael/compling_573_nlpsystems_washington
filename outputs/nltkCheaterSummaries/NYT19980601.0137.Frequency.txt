&UR; By MARTIN CARNOY AND DAVID CARNOY &LR;  &QC;   &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;   &UR; (From ``Fathers of a Certain Age'') &LR;  &QC;    It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Yet they also know that they can give their child a higher material standard of living, more father time, perhaps a higher quality of the father's time and probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the father is present.
Older parents know that they risk making their children face a father's ``early'' death.
``Sure, at some level I know I look like Alex's grandfather, and sometimes I catch strange looks, but in my mind's eye, I'm no different than they are _ just another father in the park.''
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father, his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their fathers.
His own father was 33 when Larry's grandfather died a ``normal'' death at 62, and this grandfather was 34 when his father died in 1912.
``It's funny, but I don't see myself as any older than those guys over there,'' he tells us, pointing to a couple of men in their early 30s playing with their children nearby.
One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents.
Even if an older father may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the needs of his still-young child.
I'm 54 years old and there's a child sitting on my head at 6:30 in the morning.''
