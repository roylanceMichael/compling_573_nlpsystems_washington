Many young Irish adults are breaking with earlier generations of Irish immigrants who settled in the United States for good: The Irish government reports that over the last two years, 13,000 more Irish moved back to Ireland from America than went the other way.
``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of growing up poor in Limerick (interestingly enough, after his family returned from America), has been on The New York Times Best-Seller List for 89 weeks.
Ireland's Department of Social Welfare, which earlier published ``Thinking of Going to London?''
and ``Thinking of Going to the United States?''
last year switched gears and put out ``Thinking of Returning to Ireland?''
``Now these people are going back,'' he said.
In the past, he said, ``Irish immigrants longed to return, at least sentimentally, but they realized it was impractical or impossible.''
``Before, there wasn't much to go back to,'' Convery said.
``They're not building houses,'' he said.
To economists, Ireland is now ``the Celtic tiger.''
