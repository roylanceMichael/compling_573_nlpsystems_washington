Ty Inc., the manufacturer of Beanie Babies, has printed its popular Web site address right on the heart-shaped ``hang tag'' that has accompanied all Beanies since their introduction in 1994.
We have bought (literally) into Ty's brilliant marketing strategy of maintaining interest in the Beanie collection by periodically, via the Web and their vendors, announcing the ``retirement'' of batches of Beanies.
Since Ty does not sell its products to large retailers like Toys R Us, bypassing them to sell to smaller toy and gift retailers, Beanie Babies have been a real boon to these businesses.
This results in Beanie ``hunters'' snatching up any remaining ``retirees.''
Ty then announces the introduction of new ``species'' (type of Beanie Baby) as they go into production.
Six hundred and two checked ``Beanies are my primary vocation.''
Our co-workers wonder what powerful substance, possibly embedded in the plastic pellets or ``beans'' stuffed inside these creatures, keeps us continuously on the hunt.
We've completed the on-line Beanie Baby survey on the beaniemom.com site and have discovered that even our enthusiasm for Beanie Babies pales next to others.
Our on-line forays add to the 1.6 billion hits the ty.com Beanie Baby Web site has received.
Small shops that have sold Ty products long before the Beanie craze also get preference when it comes to shipments of limited release Beanies.
