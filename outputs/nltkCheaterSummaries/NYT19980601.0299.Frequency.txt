Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said Checci's record-breaking spending of his own wealth ``is definitely in new territory.''
``It's probably Ross Perot who gave rich outsiders a bad name,'' Mellman said.
``The amateur hour is over in American politics,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic consultant who has monitored the California race.
``The voters have turned away from Checchi,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll.
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, Calif., said that Checchi's money won him name recognition, but that enthusiasm for him faded quickly.
``He came out of the block with 17 percent support from absolutely nowhere,'' Bebitch Jeffe said.
``People didn't have anything else to go on,'' said Jack Pitney, an associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College.
``I reject the `old politics' that says we have to be content with things as they are,'' Checchi said in the candidates' first televised debate.
I don't think there's ever been a case when money can buy you an election.''
``He didn't have a record, a public persona or a constituency.''
