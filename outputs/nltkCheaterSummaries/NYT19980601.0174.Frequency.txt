DETROIT _ The broad smile that ran across the face of Red Wings defenseman Jamie Macoun was about the only one visible in the Detroit dressing room after Friday night's game with the Dallas Stars.
Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said that his team was off form, but that he didn't feel they had let up on the Stars after getting the big lead.
``We probably didn't deserve to be up four to nothing, and the second half of the game ended up indicating where the game was going.''
``In the first half of the game we got some lucky bounces and ended up being up four to nothing,'' Macoun said.
``We were lucky tonight,'' said forward Martin Lapointe, who shattered the Stars' comeback hopes with the fifth Detroit goal.
``The effort was there but the passes were off a little bit and we were doing plays that just didn't work out,'' Macoun said.
Red Wings players were at a loss to explain why they weren't on their game.
Of his goal, he said, ``I didn't realize it was going to be as important as it was.
Said Macoun: ``The players and the fans all want to have a nice easy game.
