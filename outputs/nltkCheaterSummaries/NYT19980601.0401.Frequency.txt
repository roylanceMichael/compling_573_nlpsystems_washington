At the world's most famous wildlife areas, such as the Galapagos, Florida's Everglades National Park, Antarctica and East Africa's wildlife preserves, where the tameness of birds and mammals can be remarkable, even the 200-mm setting may be too powerful.
&UR; CHOOSING THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT &LR;  &QL;    The best wildlife photographs are the most natural ones, and by no means do you need powerful or costly equipment to get them.
At such ranges a 200-mm or 300-mm lens may be too powerful, but it may not be powerful enough for extremely wary animals such as jackals and leopards.
&UR; REPAYING THE ANIMALS &LR;  &QL;    Since the rewards of wildlife photography are so great, can we do something to repay the animals that make them possible?
The tips that follow are designed to minimize an animal's alarm while letting you get close enough for a good shot:    + Approach slowly in a zigzag fashion.
Wildlife magazines have conditioned us to believe closer is better, but often the best wildlife photographs show the animal in relation to more than just its immediate environment.
You can get extreme close-ups, the kind you see in wildlife magazines, by using a blind _ a tent or wooden structure with openings only large enough to accommodate a lens.
If you don't have an autofocus lens, don't waste time focusing and refocusing _ you may get only one brief chance for your shot.
If you photograph on a safari, be sure to vary your camera position _ shooting only from the Land Rover's hatch will give your pictures that telltale look of a camera always aiming down.
By supporting the cause of conservation, a photographer helps strengthen awareness of wildlife's predicament and proves that his or her interest is in the animals themselves, not merely in their images.
