Edmund Jenkins, the chairman of the accounting board, said that the new rule was needed to help protect investors in cases where companies may be investing heavily in derivatives that could result in huge losses.
&UR;  &LR; The nation's accounting rulemakers said Monday that they had given final approval to a new rule that will force companies to record the value of derivatives in their financial statements.
``If the board had backed down on derivatives, I think it would have made it very difficult for the board to be an effective standard setter in the future,'' Jenkins said.
Under a bill introduced by Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., any accounting rule proposed by the accounting board would have to be approved by federal regulators at the SEC.
The move was immediately criticized by the banking industry and other groups, who have complained so loudly in Washington about the proposed rule in recent months that a bill has been introduced to weaken the power of the private rule-making body, known as the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
The accounting board was created in 1972 as a private sector body, Jenkins said, to try to keep politics and the ``self-serving objectives of special interest groups'' out of the rulemaking process.
Several years ago, the accounting board decided to weaken another proposed rule on the accounting of employee stock options after companies complained to Congress.
In a statement Monday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a group that includes banks and other companies, said the new rule was ``a flawed product adopted in a process that ignored widespread dissent.''
Greenspan warned that the new rule could keep companies from using derivatives and could ``constrain prudent risk management practices.''
In response to the comments, the board delayed the rule's effective date by two years and agreed that companies' meeting certain requirements will not have to include the changes in a derivative's value in income.
