Torres, who is expected to be the chief witness in the case against Ms. Ramos, gave a statement to police in which she said that soon after they returned to the apartment, Serrano emerged from his hiding place fighting and that Ms. Ramos soon joined the struggle.
The nine-count indictment charges Ms. Ramos with robbery (helping take Torres' gun), second-degree murder, assaulting a police officer, weapons possession, obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest.
The indictment charges that when the officers found Serrano, who was being sought for missing a court date on an old drug charge, he and Ms. Ramos both attacked one of the officers, Miriam Sanchez Torres, 36, and grabbed her service revolver.
NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn woman accused of helping her boyfriend kill a police officer who had gone to their apartment to arrest him last week was indicted Monday on charges including second-degree murder, robbery and assaulting a police officer.
The woman, Betsy Ramos, 33, first hid her boyfriend, Jose Serrano, from the two officers as they sought to arrest him in their basement apartment in East Flatbush last Tuesday morning, police said.
It was Ms. Ramos who let Mosomillo and Torres into the apartment at 523 E. 34th St., where Serrano, 29, was hiding under the floorboards of the bedroom closet, police said.
Using Torres' gun, Serrano fatally shot Officer Anthony Mosomillo, 36, police said.
Torres told investigators that the two knocked her to the ground and that Serrano got her gun.
Ms. Ramos' lawyer, Andrew Friedman, said that his client was a battered woman who had once sought an order of protection against Serrano.
``Police Officer Anthony Mosomillo sacrificed his life in the heroic and courageous performance of his duty,'' the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, said in announcing the indictment.
