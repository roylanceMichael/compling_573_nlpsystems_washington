Harman's weekend marathon by small plane was also full of spunk and vigor _ clearly energized by what her campaign manager, Bill Carrick, said were internal polls suggesting the candidate was within 5 points' striking distance of Davis.
The differences were most dramatic in Los Angeles, where Davis and Checchi nearly crossed paths at morning services at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, a powerhouse of social and political activism.
Then, with the cadence of a preacher, Checchi talked about the state's $4 billion surplus as he delivered one of the most passionate and effective speeches of his campaign.
On Saturday, she barnstormed the state _ from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to San Jose, Sacramento, Oakland and Berkeley.
San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer, retired Rep. Ron Dellums, and state Sen. Hilda Solis of Los Angeles, also appeared along the way.
Meanwhile, state Attorney General Dan Lungren, all but unopposed for the Republican nomination, was relaxed enough to joke about how his campaign against Davis might go.
``We do not want the limp of Davis, the lip of Checchi, or the soup-warmed-over of Lungren,'' Millender-McDonald yelled to the crowd at a Santa Barbara park.
Democratic front-runner Gray Davis was fired up and emotional Sunday before a receptive congregation at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles _ and talking like a winner.
In a community center of ``Sal Si Puedes,'' the San Jose Latino heartland, Solis urged immigrant voters to support the candidate whom she said could work with both political parties and yet had  &LR; ``el corazon de una madre,''  &LR; the heart of a mother.
Lungren barnstormed across Los Angeles on Saturday, hinting about his possible strategy against Davis.
