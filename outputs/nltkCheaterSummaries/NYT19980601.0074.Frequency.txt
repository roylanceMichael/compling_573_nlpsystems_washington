A lot of the information is specific to Oregon rivers, but you'll also find some general information, including some great photography of flies.
You'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about the hottest lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well.
A good place to start is at a Web site called The Fishing Network at http://www.iwn.com/fishing.html.
Besides offering fishing tips for that section of the country, you'll find some links that would be helpful to most fishermen, including ways to get local weather conditions.
Today's final site _ Flyfishing.com at http://www.flyfishing.com _ is much more general in nature and has lots of instructional material for beginners and seasoned fly-fishermen.
The most helpful part of this site is the section that offers forums on various types of fishing and fishing-related information.
Another good general interest site is called The World of Fishing at http://www.fishingworld.com/.
One especially good feature of the site is the database of information about various flies.
So an Oregon-based site called the McKenzie Page is a terrific place to go.
Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a much better job of representing the non-technical side of life.
