John Vicari, 45, of Marlboro, N.J., former senior manager of information technology; Richard Thies, 55, of Randolph, N.J., who was director of operations; and John Mastromarino, 58, of Spotswood, N.J., former senior manager of network operations, admitted that between 1990 and 1995 they had accepted the money from three vendors of office supplies and security and computer consulting services in exchange for contracts with the company, a unit of MCI Communications Corp., the United States' second-largest long-distance telephone company.
Vicari faces up to 10 years in federal prison and $500,000 in fines; Thies faces eight years and $500,000, and Mastromarino three years and $250,000, Liebman said.
Three former managers at MCI International in Piscataway, N.J., pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges of accepting $312,000 in kickbacks from companies seeking to do business with the company.
Thies also pleaded guilty to defrauding MCI of $250,000 by paying for computer products and services the company did not receive.
Alain Liebman, an assistant U.S. attorney, declined to say whether the other MCI executives or the vendors would also be charged, but he added that he expected additional proceedings Wednesday concerning the case.
Vicari told Judge Katherine Hayden in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., that he received more than $180,000 in the scheme.
Three more MCI officials, including a vice president, were also involved in the scheme, according to court papers.
``We're pleased that justice is served,'' MCI said in a statement.
MCI paid for products and services which we never received.''
Mastromarino admitted receiving $60,000.
