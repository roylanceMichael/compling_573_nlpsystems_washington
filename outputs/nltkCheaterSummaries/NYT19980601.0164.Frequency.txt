Dashing 400 meters at the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics national track championships last weekend in Tulsa, Okla.    ``What she's accomplished has been incredible,'' said Randy Heath, Nelson's track coach at Oklahoma Christian University.
The Grand Prairie native and former Nolan High School star qualified for the NAIA championship meet at 100, 200 and 400 meters and has school records in all three events.
Nelson's dream came closer to reality this month when she was accepted into the University of Oklahoma's highly regarded physical therapy program for her senior year.
``I knew she was a very good athlete,'' Hill said.
Nelson has proved that in three years at Oklahoma Christian, an NAIA school in Oklahoma City.
She has earned NAIA All-America recognition three times in indoor competition, including her national runner-up finish in the 400 last weekend.
``They see their dad a lot, and him being here really helps me,'' Kathy Nelson said.
``It gets real tough at times,'' Nelson said.
``I'll miss running, and I'll miss Oklahoma Christian.
That changed thanks to her boss, Preschool Enrichment owner Gary Hill, an OCU graduate and a strength coach for Fort Worth Christian's athletic program.
