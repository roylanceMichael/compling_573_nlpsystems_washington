According to the police, a man had approached a priest at St. Joseph's Catholic Church on East 87th Street in Manhattan and said that someone ``was going to harm the cardinal'' at the parish's 100th anniversary Mass, which the cardinal was to celebrate that night.
No precautions were taken on Sunday morning beyond the several police officers who are always on hand for Sunday Masses at St. Patrick's.
Each year on the Feast of Pentecost, St. Patrick's Cathedral offers the Sacrament of Confirmation to people who have prepared through the archdiocese's Office for Persons with Disabilities.
Talking about a 14-year-old with multiple learning disabilities who plays baseball in a special Little League, the cardinal said, ``But he never plays on Sunday morning.''
NEW YORK _ The media turned out in force at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday, anticipating yet another in what has lately been a series of public pronouncements by Cardinal John O'Connor on issues like Little League play on Sundays and domestic partnership legislation.
The cardinal, however, stayed focused on Sunday's confirmation Mass for 25 Catholics with severe disabilities _ although he did manage to find a few opportunities to tweak the assembled reporters.
``And he will never play ball on Good Friday,'' O'Connor said.
``The cardinal used to celebrate Mass in foxholes and on the back of jeeps in Vietnam,'' Zwilling said.
O'Connor carried out his duties without special security precautions after the police investigated a possible threat against him uncovered Saturday.
The cardinal, a former Navy chaplain, was unfazed by the threat, said his spokesman, Joseph Zwilling.
