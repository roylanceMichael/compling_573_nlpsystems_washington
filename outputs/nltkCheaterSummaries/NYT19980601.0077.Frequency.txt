Assuming your investments return 8 percent a year, and assuming you pay 34 percent back in federal and state taxes, you still could accumulate about $44,300 by your child's 18th birthday.
You don't pay income tax on the earnings each year, and you don't pay taxes or penalties when you take the money out, assuming you spend it for education.
It's a big one: Financial aid totaled $50 billion last year, nearly a third of the $160 billion spent for education at 3,000 institutions.
There are three main steps to getting started:    Step one, starting when the kids are young, is to begin a college saving program and start investing the money.

You can put $500 a year _ that's about $42 a month _ into an education IRA for each child.
It boils down to how hard you're willing to dig: for scholarships rather than loans, for low-interest loans _ and how much you're willing to borrow.
Step two, when your child is in high school, is to shake the financial aid machine for all the outside help you can get.
Suppose you put away $50 a month starting when your child is born.
You might be surprised at how much money you can put away, even with a modest investment program.
