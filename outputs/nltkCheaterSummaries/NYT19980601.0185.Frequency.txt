For Japan's very economic weakness is one of East Asia's main problems: fresh growth in Japan, and prevention of deflation, are powerfully in other Asian countries' interests.
There is still much that the government must do: implementing its latest fiscal stimulus, cleaning up the financial sector and deregulating many services businesses are vital for Japan's longer-term economic health.
Japan is currently in danger of entering a deflationary spiral in which falling prices swell the real debt burden of companies, which adds to the problems of the banking sector, which further depress demand and so prices fall lower still.
To some, this is yet more evidence of Japan's deepening economic mess, and a bad harbinger for the outside world, too.
American interest rates are likely to rise over the next year to keep inflation in check, while the Bank of Japan is expected to ease policy.
And, lastly, a cheaper yen will lure new capital into Japanese equities and property, helping to ease one of the financial sector's biggest problems.
The second common objection to a weak yen is that it will widen Japan's trade surplus and so reignite demands in America for protectionist measures.

To achieve a stronger yen would require higher interest rates and monetary contraction: the opposite of what Japan needs.
Worries that a falling yen could prolong Asia's financial crisis have helped push Wall Street sharply lower.
