Two of Texas A&AMP;M's signees _ Beaumont West Brook quarterback Chip Ambres and Dallas Christian outfielder Choo Freeman _ are likely to have to turn down millions of dollars to play football for the Aggies.
AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M football teams will be sweating out today's major-league baseball amateur draft.
Other players from the state who might be picked are Texas A&AMP;M outfielder Jason Tyner, pitcher Chris George and pitcher Gary Majewski.
Baylor pitcher Kip Wells and Rice second baseman Bubba Crosby are expected to be taken in the first round.
The Oakland A's, with the second pick, are expected to draft Michigan State pitcher Mark Mulder (6-6, 3.40 ERA).
Longhorns quarterback signee Adam Dunn of New Caney is listed as one of the top 50 prospects in the country by Baseball America.
He could sneak into the first round but is a probable second-round selection if scouts aren't scared away by his football commitment to Texas.
Ambres, the state's top quarterback prospect, played outfield for West Brook and hit .500.
1 pick of the draft is expected to be University of Miami third baseman Pat Burrell, who missed 28 games with a back injury this spring.
Dunn, a first baseman who would be drafted as an outfielder, hit .533 with 32 stolen bases.
