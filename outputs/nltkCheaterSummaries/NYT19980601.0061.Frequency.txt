``It's done OK out there on it's own, and we'd love to see the animal returned to the wild, but we have to abide by state rules,'' said Busch director David Hitzig, noting that state law does not allow trappers to catch a raccoon and release it elsewhere.
But being different and kind of cute may have saved Al, because instead of ending the raccoon's life, Frederick will donate him to the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary.
``Everything we've come across, we've never seen anything like it,'' said Frederick, who has operated Animal Trapping Unlimited for about five years.
GREENACRES, Fla. _ It's not easy being different _ just ask Al, the 2-year-old albino raccoon.
Steve Coughlin, a wildlife biologist with the Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, said true and partial albinos are genetically different and are rare in animals, just as they are in humans.
``Most often what you'll see is a partial albino, which is still rare,'' he said.
His blonde hair and light-colored eyes probably made him a little easier to spot than his dark-haired relatives, and trapper Ed Frederick caught him at the Falls Country Club here recently.
The raccoon has gotten used to his cage, Frederick said, but still hisses and grunts a little when people get too close.
``Most albinos are not very healthy animals that don't live much past birth.''
``We'll give it a home,'' Hitzig said.
