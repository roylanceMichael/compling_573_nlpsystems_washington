The Bulls knew this much about Jordan, who would become the league's scoring champion 10 times: ``He was a better shooter than given credit for,'' Loughery said.
``We knew there were two franchise guys in the draft, and we got one of them,'' Loughery said from his North Atlanta home last week.
``What happened was we gave him the ball in a drill, one on one, against the whole team, and he immediately started going through guys, killing 'em,'' Loughery recalls.
``The thing is, we drafted Michael knowing he was a great athlete, even if we really didn't know he would be this great.''
``No matter who was offered, we wouldn't have taken it,'' Loughery said.
As Jordan nears the end of his basketball career, maybe one series away from retirement, Loughery recalls how it all started, how greatness dazzled like a super nova in a dingy gym one October day in 1984.
Loughery compares Jordan's will to win with Bill Russell's.
We knew we had a terrific prospect, but really, we didn't know what we had.''
Jerry Sloan (coach of the Utah Jazz) had Michael's drive to win, but he didn't have his offensive talent.
``Bill played 13 years, won 11 championships,'' Loughery said ``The other two years he was hurt.
