Blind since birth, the Civil Air Patrol communications officer stationed at Randolph Air Force Base had no problems leaping from a plane flying at 10,000 feet Friday afternoon.
With an Air Force flight suit on, Dittman had a 35-second free fall at 125 mph before jump master Rick Meyers of Skydive San Antonio Inc. opened the main parachute.
``I became bored on Tuesday and I decided to do something exciting, like skydiving,'' said Dittman, who hopes the Civil Air Patrol will give him his wings for the accomplishment.
The Civil Air Patrol is a volunteer organization that assists in air search and rescue missions and air crashes.
Dittman, a sophomore at the University of Texas at San Antonio majoring in radio, television and film, decided to skydive just three days before his jump.
``It is normal for Rob to do crazy things,'' said Victoria Archur, who read the liability forms to him before his jump.
``I just want to prove to people there are no limits, whether they are disabled or not,'' Dittman, 20, said.
``It is very depressing when people become handicapped and just sit around not doing anything,'' he said.
Dittman, who didn't tell his parents beforehand, said he wanted to skydive again.
``Motivation is his favorite word,'' Archur said.
