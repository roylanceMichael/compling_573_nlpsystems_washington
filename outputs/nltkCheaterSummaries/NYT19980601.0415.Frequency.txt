NEW YORK _ What would a newcomer to Colombian folk dance have learned from the program presented by the Ballet Nacional de Colombia on Friday night at City Center?
The high point of the evening's 18 dance numbers, which reflected Colombia's Indian, African and Spanish heritage, was ``La Cumbia,'' a group dance performed in the coastal villages.
Opening with a characteristic gliding trot for the machete-wielding men, ``La Cumbia'' built steadily with lines of candle-bearing women and their men moving slowly back and forward and weaving across the stage in dancing that was both exuberant and restrained.
Ballet Nacional, founded in 1971 by Sonia Osorio, the company's artistic director, choreographer and costume designer, has toured throughout the world.
Not a great deal if that newcomer understood no more than rudimentary Spanish, since the commentary and single-sheet program information were in Spanish.
Another highlight was the finale, ``Mercado Campesino'' (``Peasant Market''), a piece that evoked Sunday market days in small towns in the Andes.
But this was an event that was clearly aimed at nostalgic displaced Colombians, though the presentation was supported in part by City Center.
And their delight was eventually infectious, as they sang and clapped along, sighed when a favorite dance was announced, and cheered at the frequent mention of their native land.
But a surprising number of onstage and technical mishaps here suggested there had been very little rehearsal time in New York.
The swirling, vividly costumed processional included vendors of fruit, vegetables and bread as well as birds, baskets and utensils.
