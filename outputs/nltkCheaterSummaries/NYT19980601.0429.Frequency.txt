Omnipoint Corp., which provides wireless service in the New York area using GSM technology, plans to announce that it is offering the new phone Tuesday.
The other members of the alliance are: Aerial Communications Inc., Airadigm Communications Inc.; the Conestoga Wireless Company; Cook Inlet PCS; DIGIPH PCS; Microcell Telecommunications Inc.; NPI Wireless; Pacific Bell Mobile Services; Powertel Inc.; Western Wireless Corp. and Wireless 2000 PCS.
The GSM Alliance said North America's other major GSM carriers would offer the new phone by the end of the year.
George Schmitt, president of Omnipoint's wireless operation, said the phone would probably cost $299 and would let users make and receive calls in foreign countries as if they were at home.
After Omnipoint, the next carrier to offer the new phone will be BellSouth's Mobility DCS operation.
The GSM Alliance, a group made up of 13 North American GSM wireless companies, said the new phone could be used in more than 110 countries.
The new phone is based on a digital technology known as global system for mobile communications, or GSM.
People who use Omnipoint and other GSM wireless carriers can often do those things already, but they generally must first get a special phone for use abroad.
NEW YORK _ Audiovox Corp. and the Bosch Telecom unit of Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany plan to announce Tuesday the availability of a wireless telephone that can operate on different continents without modification.
``It's equally important that people coming here from overseas be able to get a clear service.''
