``We'd get fresh investment and technology, while Delta would get a partner in Brazil,'' said Jorge Honorio, a Transbrasil spokesman in Brazil.
``The partnership with Transbrasil and the Brazil service have been very successful,'' said spokesman Bill Berry.
That means Delta can book passengers not just between Atlanta and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two cities where its jets fly, but also to Transbrasil's destinations within Brazil.
But a spokesman acknowledged a continued relationship with Transbrasil is important for Delta's year-old service to Brazil.
ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines may buy a minority stake in Brazilian partner Transbrasil, which needs fresh capital amid fare wars that followed deregulation of the country's airline industry.
Transbrasil, likewise, can book passengers on Delta's U.S. flights.
Under their current relationship, which doesn't include any investment by Delta, the two carriers sell seats on each other's flights.
Delta also has a partnership with Aeropostal of Venezuela, where it started service in April, but that deal does not include any investment.
Delta has numerous code-share deals with carriers in Europe, but its only financial investment is a 5 percent equity stake in Swissair.
Delta earlier had a similar deal with Varig, a larger Brazilian carrier, but Varig called off the partnership last year.
