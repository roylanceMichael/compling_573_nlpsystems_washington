If Phelps is right, if hell _ the ultimate hot spot _ is filling up with the unholy likes of Goldwater and Sinatra and Princess Di and Mother Teresa, th ere's only one thing left I'd like to know.
You're saying it's OK to sin, because if the Bible is wrong on that weighty matter, then it's not reliable on any matter.''
Fred Phelps is correct _ and by God he believes he is _ then former Sen. Barry Goldwater is now a resident of hell.
He explained , ``When you want to say it's OK to be gay, then you're saying God is a liar and the Bible is not a reliable guide.
After the death of Princess Diana, Westboro Baptist Church issued a s tatement reading, ``God Almighty has again manifested His hot displeasure against the prevailing depravity of these last days by dramatically snuffing out the hedonistic life of a leading international symbol of immoral, god-defying decadence.''
Phelps is sending a squad    of holy warriors to picket Goldwater's funeral Wednesday.
Sonny Bono is in hell, Phelps says, for not condemning his gay daughter, Chastity.
You can rely on him and his parading zealots from Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., to have something to say, to stage some protest, to try to get on TV, after the death of any person with a big name.
The reason they'll travel to Goldwater's service, he said, ``is because this nation needs to be preached to.
