Powdered rhinoceros horn is also a favored treatment for impotence (fewer than 12,000 rhinos remain in the world), as are potions made with the remains of the masked palm-civet, an endangered mongoose-like animal.
Since plants have also yielded many drugs recognized as effective by western medicine, it is likely that some of these herbal cures would withstand scientific scrutiny.
But the distinction between medicine and magic is often a fine one, and when ``cures'' are based not on the chemical diversity of plants but on the alleged attributes of wild animals, the success of any treatment is surely all in the mind.
At the moment, according to Steve Trent of the Environmental Investigation Agency in London, which studies ``crimes against nature,'' trade in tiger parts is killing more of the beasts than the destruction of their forest habitat.
On the face of it, then, Asia should be a fertile market for Viagra, and tigers, rhinos and civets might thus have some of the pressure lifted from them.
Yu Han, a Chinese-medicine specialist based in London, notes that most such medicines are parts of plants _ lotus stems, for example.
Tigers are not amused: only 5,500-7,500 are left in the wild, and dozens are poached and chopped up each year for use in traditional medicines.
