But in winning the WBA junior-middleweight title from Moore and the World Boxing Council middleweight title from Iran Barkley in 1989, Duran was an idol again in Panama, where he once punched out a horse.
I said, `Somebody hold the money,' then I walked over and hit the horse behind the ear and the horse went down.''
``I don't want to talk a lot about Joppy, I want to show you,'' he said, sitting near the Garden ring in the exposition hall where he and other boxers will train this week.
NEW YORK _ Nearly 100 fights and 27 years ago, Roberto Duran arrived in New York, a 20-year-old Panamanian lightweight with a 25-0 record and the sneering snarl of a Caribbean pirate in an old Errol Flynn movie.
In his eighth Garden bout, he will try to dislodge the World Boxing Association middleweight title from William Joppy before Evander Holyfield defends his heavyweight title against Henry Akinwande.
He doubled up Buchanan with a low blow, took the title in the 13th round and everybody in boxing knew who Roberto Duran was.
Then this guy said, `I'll bet you a bottle of whisky and $50 you can't knock out that horse over there.'
But the horse isn't why Roberto Duran is known as Manos de Piedras, meaning hands of stone.
He'll be 47 years old in two weeks, but Saturday night he will go up the steps into the Garden ring again, this time with a 102-13 record, with 69 knockouts.
``Even a lot of people in my country didn't think I would beat Moore,'' he said, ``but I did.''
