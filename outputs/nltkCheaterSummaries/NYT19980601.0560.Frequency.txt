Then Ms. Amorini brought the graduates to their feet applauding when she said, ``York College gave me the necessary remedial course, which allowed me to pass the written English exam the second time I took it.
NEW YORK _ While graduates of York College in Queens basked in sunshine and congratulations at their commencement, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's policies took a drubbing Monday.
The new admissions plan was also criticized by the commencement speaker, John Hope Franklin, an emeritus professor of history at Duke University and chairman of the advisory board of One America, President Clinton's committee on race relations.
What made the occasion contentious was the vote last Tuesday by the CUNY board of trustees, at the mayor's urging, to discontinue remedial classes at the 11 senior colleges in the system, including York.
``Nothing I learned at Harvard,'' he said, ``was more important and rewarding to me than teaching a grown man how to read and write.''
Alfred Curtis Jr., a trustee who has supported the campaign to phase out remedial courses, was drowned out by boos and catcalls Monday morning at York, in Jamaica, as he tried to express greetings from fellow trustees.
Franklin began by urging the graduates ``not to feel inferior or inadequate because you took a remedial course.''
Ms. Amorini of East Elmhurst, Queens, a native of Argentina, began by telling of the difficulties she encountered as a single parent who also cared for her younger brother, who is severely retarded.
The demonstration at York College's 28th commencement ceremony was not wholly spontaneous.
She said that after entering York College in 1993, she failed the English writing test.
