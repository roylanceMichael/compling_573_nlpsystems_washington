Film: ``Almost Heroes''    Directed by: Christopher Guest    Stars: Chris Farley and Matthew Perry    Rated: PG-13 for crude humor, backside nudity and slapstick violence    Score: 1 1/2 on a scale of 1-5
Farley does a lot of bellowing and screaming in ``Almost Heroes,'' but nobody could have saved this script, written by a trio whose names don't merit looking up.
In the very first scene of ``Almost Heroes,'' Chris Farley is on the gallows, telling the crowd what it can do with his fat rump.
But the change of character doesn't make for much of a change in the performance, and the gallows opening isn't the only reminder of Farley's demise.
Call it the ``Friends'' curse _ like his cast mates David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston, who also made bad movies this year, he seems forever doomed to play his TV persona.
He doesn't really play well off Perry, but then Perry seems uncomfortable throughout, throwing out his usual engaging cleverness in favor of a pomposity that never really finds the right note.
Less than a year after his ``Waiting for Guffman'' made some of 1997's 10-best lists, he's delivered a movie that's a good bet for 1998's 10-worst lists.
Maybe Guest needs to write his own material when he directs; whatever the case, he winds up with a movie about cross-country exploration in which everyone in the cast seems to be going in a separate direction, and nothing seems to click.
His philosophy seemed to be that no matter how lame the line, bellowing it would make it funny; no matter how weak the sight gag, if Farley screamed and abused himself enough, maybe you'd at least crack a smile.
Most of Farley's earlier movie characters were innocent doofuses, but Hunt knows his way through the wilderness; he just suffers a lot of indignities in finding it.
