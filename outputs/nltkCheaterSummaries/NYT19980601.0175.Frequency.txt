DETROIT _ Martin Lapointe glided into a vacated Dallas Stars zone, behind a vacated Stars net where he passed Stars goalie Ed Belfour, who had ventured from his crease to play the puck.
The Stars goalie went down either writhing in pain (Belfour's version) or trying to draw a penalty (Lapointe's version).
It was Detroit's fifth and final goal, and it was the one that sealed a 5-3 Red Wings victory in Game 3.
From there, Lapointe either slashed Belfour's leg (Belfour's version) or Belfour took a dive (Lapointe's version).
``That wasn't one of Eddie's best nights,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock admitted.
Said Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner: ``We can't expect Eddie to stand on his head every night.
The second goal by defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom looked to be heading wide, only to hit Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher's skate and deflect in.
The fourth goal sailed over Belfour's shoulder, this time by Red Wings defenseman Jamie Macoun.
He allowed the biggest after the Stars had battled back to pull within 4-3 in Game 3.
The first goal began with an odd-man rush, and ended when Red Wings winger Brent Gilchrist whistled a shot high and over his shoulder.
