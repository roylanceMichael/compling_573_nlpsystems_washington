Continuing on our tour of the May honor roll, closer Robb Nen started the month with four saves and finished with 14, leaving him one short of the league lead held by Cincinnati's Jeff Shaw and San Diego's Trevor Hoffman.
In his typical praise-others style, Rueter (7-3) insisted it meant little to him sharing the NL victory lead with Pittsburgh's Jason Schmidt, Houston's Mike Hampton and the Atlanta quartet of Tom Glavine, Kevin Millwood, Greg Maddux and Denny Neagle, who failed to earn his eighth win last night.
Snow and right fielder Stan Javier still haven't found their strokes, and catcher Brian Johnson is just beginning to rediscover his, as he showed with two solo homers in Sunday's 7-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
They also scored twice in the eighth on a two-error play for a 7-1 lead, which became a 7-4 final when Arizona scored three runs off Julian Tavarez in the ninth with the aid of two bad-hop hits.
While Orel Hershiser deservedly got most of the ink for his 5-0 record and 0.67 ERA, left-hander Kirk Rueter has won four of his past five starts to sneak into a tie for the National League lead in victories with seven.
As long as our pitching staff stays intact and we keep away from injuries, the sky's the limit as far as how high we can go,'' he said.
If the question is whether the the 33-24 Giants are playing as well as they can, manager Dusty Baker would answer with an emphatic ``no.''
They have seven meetings against the first-place San Diego Padres, and four interleague games against the A's, who always find a way to give them a searing pain behind the temples.
Johnson led off the third with a homer that tied the game 1-1, then opened the fifth with a much longer blow that put the Giants ahead 2-1.
Yet Bonds was no factor Sunday as the Giants finished the month with their third straight win against Arizona after the D-backs took the series opener.
