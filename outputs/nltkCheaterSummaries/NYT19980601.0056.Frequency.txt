Bender's family and Parker _ in a statement issued after Sunday's preliminary autopsy _ said Bender died ``from complications resulting from a seizure.''
The statement also said, ``Although the final and conclusive report will not be available for two weeks, the coroner at this time has ruled out foul play, drugs or alcohol as factors in his death.''
``Al was devastated, like everyone is,'' club executive Bruce Allen said Sunday.
According to a recorded message left by police spokesman Robert Quigley, ``no foul play is suspected'' in Bender's death.
``It had not been a problem at all during most of his college career,'' Allen said.
Janay Leddy, the graduate assistant in Washington State's sports information office, referred to Bender's ``infectious'' smile.
``When you looked him in the eye, he had a sparkle,'' Allen said.
A spokeswoman for the Cobb County medical examiner's office said there was no indication that medication contributed to Bender's death.
Allen said the Raiders were aware of Bender's medical condition when they selected him in the second round of the NFL draft on April 18.
Everyone on our medical staff was confident of that.''
