Still, the frequency and distance of McGwire's home runs have earned him the right to be put in the illustrious company of the mythical Babe Ruth.
This season's pace, with two-thirds of a season still to go, has McGwire hitting over 80 home runs, which simply isn't going to happen.
No stranger to tape-measure home runs, McGwire last year deposited a pitch delivered by fireballer Randy Johnson some 538 feet from home plate, and tagged another months later that went 517 feet.
Take McGwire's latest home-run tear: From May 12 to May 24, he launched seven home runs that rocketed out of ballparks at distances estimated between 440 and 545 feet, with five traveling more than 470 feet.
That still leaves McGwire around 300 home runs behind the Sultan of Swat, and it's doubtful he can reach him, given his age (34) and that he is injury-prone, which accounted for missing more than 300 games alone between 1993 and 1995.
Indeed, it sounds like heresy to say it, but the St. Louis Cardinals slugger may actually be hitting more home runs of Ruthian proportions that the almighty Ruth himself.
``When people put my name next to Ruth's name,'' McGwire recently said, ``it still blows me away.
Whether he can eclipse Maris' coveted record, which has stood the test of time 37 years, longer than Ruth's previous record of 60, also remains very much to be seen.
McGwire recently edged past Ruth to have the highest percentage of home runs per at bats over the course of a career.
What we know is simply anecdotal, but stories abound of Ruth hitting king-sized home runs.
