On Friday, after the Belgium game, Glenn Hoddle had said: ``He needs to get fitter and sharper but he's worked extremely hard and he's still got time.''

Hoddle, who has backed Gascoigne over his wife-beating, his ``re-fuelling'' problems, his late nights and early baths, finally accepted that this prodigal son could not be kept in the fold.
It could have the times he was caught in possession, the times he gave the ball away, the times he raged at the referee.
He may still be feeling his way back into regular football but he can attack defenses with the ball or pass it through them.
All of these things Glenn Hoddle saw as he watched Paul Gascoigne playing in Morocco last week.
If Gascoigne plays, Hoddle has to pick Ince and Batty to compensate for his lack of mobility and his tendency to give the ball away in dangerous areas.
Gascoigne was on the playing field for 170 minutes in the three games against Saudi Arabia, Belgium and Morocco this last week but he only played in short bursts.
Hoddle had added: ``There's no question that he has the talent, that he can pass the ball.
All this nagged away at Hoddle's mind as he considered his England team this weekend and then he acted.
