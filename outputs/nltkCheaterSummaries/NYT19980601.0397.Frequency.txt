The film, directed by Australian auteur Peter Weir _ director of ``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' (1975), ``Gallipoli'' (1981), ``Witness'' (1985), ``Dead Poets Society'' (1989) and ``Fearless'' (1993) _ is deep and deeper, a far cry from Carrey's ``Ace Ventura'' noodlings or ``Liar, Liar'' (1997).
``Profound'' is not a word usually associated with Jim Carrey movies or, for that matter, with summer flicks in general, but many who've seen the film have been applying it to Carrey's latest cinematic effort, ``The Truman Show.''
``It's a little bit of a Salvador Dali painting, this movie, in the way that personally, I've been showing you what's on the surface and all that,'' he says, ``but now I'm lifting up the ocean to show you the sleeping dog there.
Carrey revels in the fact that ``The Truman Show'' is unlike anything he's done before.
``It's very parallel to my life in many, many ways,'' Carrey says.
``There's also the reality of my life and the media attention _ people love me, and their kids love me,'' he says.
``You can't live that way,'' Carrey insists.
If I can't trust him, I basically can't be directed.'''
``This script was a realization of something that I'd already thought about, suddenly come to fruition somehow,'' says Carrey, a tall, lanky guy looking uncharacteristically GQ in a dashing, pinstriped navy suit.
