And then, after the final show at Houston's Rice Stadium on Sunday, June 7, Strait will go back to attending rodeos and spending time with his wife, Norma (they've been married more than 25 years), and 17-year-old son George Junior, known as Bubba, even as his latest CD, ``One Step at a Time,'' stays fixed in the Top Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth Brooks, Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes.
For example, says West, after the success of ``Pure Country'' (in which Strait played, gosh, a country singer who loves rodeo!
Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
``He did `Pure Country' because he got a script he liked, he could do it in Texas, and he had some time off,'' she says.
``That little folder wasn't even 2 inches thick,'' says West, Strait's longtime publicist.
``He's just a very humble, unassuming gentleman; that's why, in one respect, he doesn't enjoy the hoopla,'' says Minick, who first saw Strait when he was opening (yes, opening) for Rusty Weir in 1982.
The soundtrack to the 1992 movie ``Pure Country'' sold 5 million copies.
And the fans _ young and old, male and female _ keep showing up as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career: This year's tour, officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy Truck Country Music Festival, totals just 18 dates, including Saturday's show at Texas Stadium.
Three years later, ``Strait Out of the Box'' is one of the most popular boxed sets of all time.
Strait, West says, stipulated that the shows be on Saturdays and Sundays only so he can fly home (he has a home in San Antonio and a ranch somewhere in South Texas) on his private plane for several days each week.
