His first LP, ``Strait Country,'' was released that September, and within a few years _ on the strength of songs such as ``Right or Wrong,'' ``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``You Look So Good in Love'' _ he was a major star.
Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
Also, Strait has cut eight Blaker songs, including ``She Lays It All on the Line'' on the ``Pure Country'' soundtrack.
And then, after the final show at Houston's Rice Stadium on Sunday, June 7, Strait will go back to attending rodeos and spending time with his wife, Norma (they've been married more than 25 years), and 17-year-old son George Junior, known as Bubba, even as his latest CD, ``One Step at a Time,'' stays fixed in the Top Five of the national country charts despite new releases by Garth Brooks, Shania Twain and LeAnn Rimes.
For example, says West, after the success of ``Pure Country'' (in which Strait played, gosh, a country singer who loves rodeo!
``He's just a very humble, unassuming gentleman; that's why, in one respect, he doesn't enjoy the hoopla,'' says Minick, who first saw Strait when he was opening (yes, opening) for Rusty Weir in 1982.
``That little folder wasn't even 2 inches thick,'' says West, Strait's longtime publicist.
And the fans _ young and old, male and female _ keep showing up as Strait trims his already lean approach to his career: This year's tour, officially Nokia Presents The George Strait Chevy Truck Country Music Festival, totals just 18 dates, including Saturday's show at Texas Stadium.
Billy Bob's Texas marketing director Pam Minick has known Strait for more than a decade; she says the Strait you hear and the Strait you see in his simple videos is the genuine article.
Blaker's band did ``around 100'' shows with Strait's, and then Strait invited him along as an opener in the '80s.
