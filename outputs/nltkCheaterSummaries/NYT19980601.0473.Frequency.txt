Once the acquisition is completed, American Home Products and Monsanto will spend $3 billion annually on research _ $2 billion on pharmaceuticals and $1 billion on agriculture.
Yet, by merging with Monsanto, American Home Products will be able to double its research spending to $3 billion annually, add several new drugs to its pipeline and bolster its position in genomics research, a process which uses genes to develop drug compounds.
Analysts noted that the deal, which would create a combined company with $96 billion in market capitalization and $23 billion in sales, would help American Home Products cover its legal liabilities over its diet drugs, Redux and Pondimin, one half of the combination known as fen-phen.
For example, the combined company has yet to be named and the two chief executives, Stafford at American Home Products, and Robert Shapiro at Monsanto, will run the company as joint chairmen.
American Home Products and Monsanto are two of the world's largest sellers of agricultural products, including Roundup, the world's most popular herbicide, and namebrand insecticides like Counter and Fastac.
NEW YORK _ In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceuticals industry, American Home Products Corp. announced on Monday that it would acquire Monsanto Co., the herbicides giant, for $34.4 billion in stock.
Under the terms, American Home Products will swap 1.15 of its shares for each Monsanto share and will control 65 percent of the new company's stock.
American Home Products spent $1.5 billion on research and development last year, while Pfizer spent $2 billion and Merck $1.683 billion.
Robert Blount, a senior executive vice president at American Home Products, will be the new company's chief financial officer.
Monsanto has five drugs that should enter final stage of trials this year, while American Home Products could launch several top selling drugs within the next several years, including Embrel, a joint venture with Immunex for rheumatoid arthritis.
