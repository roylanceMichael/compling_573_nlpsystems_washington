For many children who have felt self-conscious about their unique moles and birthmarks on their face, seeing another ``child'' with the same features boosts their self-esteem, said Dave Liggett, public affairs director for My Twinn.
SAN ANTONIO _ Four-year-old Brandon Duke's best buddy is 23 inches tall, with a soft body and a face with a striking resemblance to Brandon's.
``It's awesome,'' she said of the fact her doll shares the mark with her.
``I wanted their kids to see how cute they were when they were little,'' Duke said.
``They are not just making dolls; they are making a special gift,'' Liggett said.
``It was amazing,'' Christina said of the resemblance.
Ellen Duke, a physician in San Antonio, has bought four My Twinn dolls, including one matching what she looked like as a young girl.
``They are always going to grow up, but you can never have that feeling again when they were little,'' she said.
One day in January, Brandon's new friend, a My Twinn doll, arrived in the mail.
Christina's doll was an early gift for her 13th birthday on June 14.
