``A guy like me,'' he said, ``I don't understand how Arrowood can charge $50, and this doesn't need to take a backseat.''
First we tasted a 1996 Sonoma County Chardonnay, which St. Jean called ``lush,'' but M.J. found too ``oaky'' for her taste.
``It's not filtered or fined,'' Riffo said, holding his glass up to the light.
``It's minty,'' she said.
``I was surprised that it's only $22,'' he said.
When she tasted a 1994 Sonoma County Reserve Speciale Cabernet, M.J. said, ``Wow!''
In fact, it's called a ``thief,'' and it scooped up 1997 Barricia Vineyard Chardonnay from an old cask and then from a new cask.
It said: ``Luncheon at the Chateau Honoring our Guests Mr. Lowell Cohn, Mr. Garry St. Jean and Friends.''
``When are we going wine tasting?''
``I don't spit it out,'' he said.
