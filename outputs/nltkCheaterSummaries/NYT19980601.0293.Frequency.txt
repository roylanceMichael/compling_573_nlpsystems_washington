Ferretti to Open in SoHo    NEW YORK _ Ever since acquiring a building at 30 West 56th St. for her U.S. headquarters a few years ago, Alberta Ferretti has been extending the reach of her company outside Italy.
Barneys New York will introduce the Henry Cuir collection in the fall, said Judith Collinson, the store's general merchandise manager for women's ready-to-wear and accessories.
Ms. Ferretti is doing the reverse, because a space became available that was the right size for Philosophy and because she felt that SoHo was the best place to attract the with-it customers to whom the line appeals.
Most designers and fashion companies open flagship stores for their signature lines first to establish a presence, and then follow with boutiques for their secondary lines.
Beguelin has formed a new leather-goods company in Milan, Italy, called Henry Cuir, using the French word for leather.
Murani retains the rights to the name Henry Beguelin and plans to continue producing handbags and other leather goods in Italy in the trademark Beguelin style, utilizing African trade beads and embroideries.
That store, at 452 West Broadway, near Prince Street, is for the Philosophy collection, a lower-priced version of the signature line aimed at a younger woman.
She recently opened in-store boutiques for her signature and Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti lines at Bergdorf Goodman.
The area is enjoying a rebirth, with an influx of designer boutiques, making SoHo a fashionable shopping destination again after years during which it threatened to become more like a mall with mass merchants taking over.
The stark interior, softened by a curving cashier's counter of ebonized maple and an ornamental niche on the second floor, should be an appropriate background for the softly feminine clothes with their delicate details and colors.
