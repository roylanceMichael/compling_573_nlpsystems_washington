Her report:    You get the Family Finder index (a list of 130 million people who can be traced through birth, marriage, census and miscellaneous records); the Social Security Death Index (birth and death dates, Social Security number and last ZIP code for 54 million people); and the World Family Tree (130 million people on family trees submitted by 27,000 family researchers).
I would recommend Family Tree Maker (about $90) for anyone whose primary interest is gathering material _ not only are the World Family Tree discs rich in information, but the publisher, Broderbund, offers another 100 databases of government and historical records.
Although you can have the ``agents'' on Family Tree Maker's Web page search for every name in your file, there wasn't much point to look for all our Elizabeths who were listed only by given name.
You can search the Internet for every name in your file, add a Family Tree Maker book to your home page and take advantage of a free record lookup from Genealogy Research Associates.
Most of FTM's reports are excellent, but each time a new version comes out I have to figure out all over again how to print an ancestor tree with multiple pages.
Ultimate Family Tree's premiere version is an ideal choice for anyone whose emphasis is on organization and verification, and a bargain at $60.
Although much of the material on the World Family Tree needs to be verified, it will give you a starting point for your search.
ATLANTA _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer programs, with more than 1 million copies sold.
It is an excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs that come with the deluxe version.
Entering information is intuitive _ the family group screen includes information on both the husband and wife: birth, death and marriage dates, parents and children.
