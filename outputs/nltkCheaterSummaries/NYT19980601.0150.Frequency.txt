His first LP, ``Strait Country,'' was released that September, and within a few years _ on the strength of songs such as ``Right or Wrong,'' ``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``You Look So Good in Love'' _ he was a major star.
Also, Strait has cut eight Blaker songs, including ``She Lays It All on the Line'' on the ``Pure Country'' soundtrack.
Blaker's band did ``around 100'' shows with Strait's, and then Strait invited him along as an opener in the '80s.
``There's an acknowledgement that this won't go on forever,'' says West.
``You can't imagine the phone calls, the number of people thinking they had found him.''
``This tells you about George's status in Texas,'' says West.
And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981; his first single for the label, ``Unwound,'' charted in early May, just before he turned 29.
Strait's career has continued to prosper despite changing times; he was named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music.
John Wheat, sound archivist for the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, says Strait ``appeals to people who want at least a modicum of authenticity.
``Whenever I'm around him, he's the same old George to me,'' says Blaker.
