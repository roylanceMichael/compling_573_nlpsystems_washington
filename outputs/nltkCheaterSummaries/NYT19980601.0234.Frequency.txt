The difference between expensive lump hardwood charcoal and briquettes is the extra fillers and lighting compounds that are added to the cheaper briquettes.
Natural lump hardwood charcoal, which contains no additives or fillers, is making a comeback as it burns 250 times cleaner and at 100 hotter than briquettes.
Natural lump charcoal costs a bit more than charcoal briquettes, but it burns hotter, requires fewer lumps and partially burned natural lump charcoal can be reused.
Lump hardwood charcoal, however, is considerably more expensive than briquettes.
(Ford took wood left over from making cars and ground and pressed it into briquettes, which were often sold at car dealers, so early motorists could stop and cook lunch along the road.)
Briquettes or wood chunks packed in a single-use waxed bag, which is set on fire, are convenient for tailgating and picnics, since they are easy to handle and leave nothing to cart home afterward.
Also, some briquettes burn better than others depending on their respective additives, and prices vary.
Briquettes work better for long cooking periods, because they produce more consistent heat.
Rather than totally charcoal, briquettes are made of powdered charcoal from tree bark, sawdust and scrap lumber and mixed with petroleum extracts, limestone, sodium nitrate and borax to aid in shaping and lighting.
Charcoal briquettes, which were invented after World War II by automotive entrepreneur Henry Ford, are a matter of preference.
