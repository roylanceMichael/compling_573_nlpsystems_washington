Glenn practices for emergencies in NASA training program    (EDS: Corrects spelling in second graph to rappelling)    By Scott Montgomery    C. 1998 COX NEWS SERVICE    HOUSTON _ Astronaut-trainee John Glenn joined the rest of his space crew Monday in a half-day training session on emergency evacuations from the space shuttle.
Glenn, Ohio's senior senator and NASA's senior space man, practiced rappelling down the sides of a shuttle mockup in a drill designed to hone crew coordination in the event of an emergency after a successful landing.
But Flight Commander Curt Brown, who has flown four space shuttle missions and has logged nearly 1,000 hours in space, gently admonished his crew to step lively next time.
``Today was training, and everybody did great,'' Brown said, but added, ``We could speed it up a little.''
``Very nice,'' trainer Sharon Jones told the crew when they'd finished the drill that involved exiting through an escape hatch at the top of the craft.
``It's a little different every time you do it,'' Glenn, 76, said during the three evacuation drills.
He said he's planning to fly to Arizona later this week to attend a funeral for former Sen. Barry Goldwater, who died last week at 89.
For the training, each astronaut wore a bright orange flight suit similar to the ones they'll wear during the 9-day mission scheduled to begin October 29.
The crew members had done these same exercises individually, but Monday was the first time they worked together.
The suit weighs about 100 pounds and includes an array of survival essentials from a built-in life raft with dye pack to 2 liters of drinking water, a flare kit, radio and parachute.
