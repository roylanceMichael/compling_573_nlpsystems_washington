Fifty years ago Wednesday some 800 astronomers and VIPs gathered under the new Hale Telescope on the summit of Palomar Mountain, near San Diego, to celebrate the telescope's ``first light,'' as astronomers call the moment when a new telescope is opened to the night sky for the first time.
Earlier this year, Dr. Stephen Eikenberry, a Caltech astronomer, used a high-speed infrared camera on the Hale to take ``movies'' of black holes swallowing matter inside our galaxy, shot at 10 frames a second.
``The vast majority of the parts were designed and built for the telescope, and were machined or cast by hand _ even the smallest parts of ball bearings,'' Petrie said.
In 1963, Maarten Schmidt was using the Hale to examine quasars when he discovered that quasars are not the nearby stars astronomers had assumed them to be, but powerful, brilliant objects in the distant reaches of the universe, a discovery that revealed that the universe contains objects of almost incredible energy.
The glass spent a year cooling in a special oven, and then it was carried across the United States to the Caltech optical shop in Pasadena, while crowds gathered along the tracks to watch the ``Telescope Train'' pass.
``Assuming there are no major wars, and rocket flights are routine, then I can imagine all astronomy being done in space,'' Kulkarni said.
Allan Sandage spent 20 years using the Hale to explore the size and age of the universe, a project that seems to have a grandeur beyond almost any other quest in science.
The opticians gave the mirror its final shape by hand, rubbing it with polishing disks the size of coins, using the finest jeweler's rouge, even using powdered walnut shells.
``I've moved the telescope by hand,'' Petrie said.
``We saw evidence of material flowing into a black hole and suddenly disappearing,'' Eikenberry said.
