The main stadium for the 1998 World Cup of Soccer will bring the eyes of the world to this hard-working industrial town of 92,000 at the northern edge of Paris.
When the French government chose a site in Saint-Denis for a new stadium to accommodate the 1998 World Cup, city officials saw the project as an opportunity for further redevelopment.
Development of a new neighborhood is promised near the stadium after the World Cup, and adjacent land already has been commercially developed with Europe's largest sporting goods store and a multiscreen cinema.
The town's Communist deputy mayor (now the mayor), Patrick Braouezec, was appointed co-chair of the regional organizational committee for the World Cup.
The town also expects economic gain from the visitors the stadium brings, both for the World Cup and for other events throughout the year.
The site, at the northern end of La Plaine and just outside what had been the wall of the historic town, was ideally situated to spur new development.
There's also a small but worthy Museum of Art and History, created from a former convent; the Christofle Museum, at the site of the famous silversmith factory; and a traditional market, in a late 19th-century shed just off the town center.
When Saint-Denis welcomes the world to the tournament's opening match on June 10, the world will find itself already there.
SAINT-DENIS, France _ The huge metal ring shimmers and gleams in the middle distance, like a gigantic alien spacecraft looming at the edge of town.
La Plaine now constitutes the southern half of Saint-Denis and is home to numerous audio-visual, research and manufacturing industries, including the plant where France's high-speed rail cars are built.
