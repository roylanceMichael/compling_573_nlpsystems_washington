Sometimes cab drivers claim they don't know the way to where you want to go _ one Israeli cabbie in Midtown said he did not know how to get to the Waldorf _ often, apparently, because they do not deem the destination would be rewarding enough for them.
ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York City's 44,000 taxicab drivers are under fire as an industry for driving recklessly and behaving crudely to their passengers and pedestrians.
Union representatives of the cabbies and some academic analysts attribute the unacceptable behavior to how money made from driving taxis is divided between owners of the cars and the people who drive them.
The cabbies among them quickly discover that driving in New York City is a hard way to earn a living.
Those problems should be addressed through the licensing procedures in the same way that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has gotten important reforms on liability insurance and raising the amount of fines cabbies face for improper driving.
And, as for many immigrants, the streets and buildings of New York City are where they begin their ``pursuit of happiness'' on the lowest rungs of the American economic ladder.
But in recent years, as the crackdown on criminals produced measurable success, the peril to pedestrians and taxi passengers has increased dramatically as traffic accidents involving taxis escalated 40 percent between 1990 and 1996.
The drivers are under unrelenting pressure to make the $120 or so they have to pay to rent the cab for a 12-hour shift before they see any returns for themselves, usually ranging between $60 and $80 a shift.
When immigrants try to make it in America, they almost always have a hard time, doing the sort of jobs that those already on the premises regard as beneath them.
In my last three dozen or so Manhattan cab rides, I cannot recollect one ``thank you'' for a fine tip.
