The Red Sox are still 7 1/2 games behind New York (nine in the loss column), but the final two games of the home-and-home series served to remind New Yorkers that Boston will not go down gently and that any team with Martinez and a healthy Bret Saberhagen is dangerous in a short, October series.
``When you've got a team like that down, you've got to keep them down,'' said Vaughn.
It wasn't until People's Choice Lou Merloni saved the day with a spectacular backhanded stab that led to an inning-ending double play that the Sox got back to the safety of their dugout.
The insufferable New Yorkers may indeed have the best team in baseball, the Team of the Century, and the team against which all future juggernauts will be measured.
Dennis Eckersley, who was on the mound for four of the eight batters in the inning and got out of the jam, said it was possible that some players might interpret the outburst as finger-pointing, but said, ``I didn't think he was talking to anyone in particular.
Big Mo didn't want to discuss his dugout implosion, and wouldn't specify what was said, but admitted, ``I just get upset when I don't feel we're being aggressive enough.
Boston got back on track and scored a couple of more runs to finish off a 13-7, face-saving, series-squaring victory over the hated first-place New Yorkers.
He's the leader of this team and he got into it a little bit.''
And for at least a little while longer, Mo Vaughn is around to make sure the Sox don't lose their way.
On the last day of May, in front of a capacity crowd in the House That Ruth Built, your Red Sox administered a butt-kicking that could carry them into the summer with confidence.
