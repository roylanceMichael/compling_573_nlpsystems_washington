Let's just stop here and say a Holy Moly from St. Jean is praise of the highest order.
Arrowood's owner, Richard Arrowood, used to be the winemaker at St. Jean, put that place on the map before starting his own winery.
Before long, a St. Jean Holy Moly may become the wine equivalent of two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert.
But by now, St. Jean's attention was elsewhere.
First we tasted a 1996 Sonoma County Chardonnay, which St. Jean called ``lush,'' but M.J. found too ``oaky'' for her taste.
St. Jean said, ``I love it.''
``You watch (Lakers coach) Del Harris,'' St. Jean said.
It said: ``Luncheon at the Chateau Honoring our Guests Mr. Lowell Cohn, Mr. Garry St. Jean and Friends.''
In my tasting notes on the chardonnay, I have St. Jean saying, ``Boy, is that good.''
St. Jean was falling in love with this wine all over again.
