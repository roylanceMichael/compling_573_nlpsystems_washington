Baby, It's You    10 p.m. Tuesday on PBS    Produced, written and directed by Anne Makepeace; Jennifer Chinlund and Ms. Makepeace, editors; Uta Briesewitz, director of photography; Simon Kendall, music.
``Baby, It's You'' is Anne Makepeace's earnest report of a year of trying, with her husband, Peter Behrens, to have a baby in the new-fashioned way, with the help of fertility drugs and techniques that pluck unfertilized eggs from a woman's ovaries, combine them with sperm and insert them in her fallopian tubes.
His younger sister's recent abortion stirs painful memories of Ms. Makepeace's own abortion 30 years ago.
NEW YORK _ ``P.O.V.,'' the public television showcase for independent documentaries, begins its summer season Tuesday night with an offering from the true-confessions department.
The exchanges between Ms. Makepeace and Behrens as they endure their emotional ups and downs become particularly wearing.
Ms. Makepeace has nothing good to say about the long-abandoned rules of privacy that her older relatives tell of observing before the video revolution, but inhibitions about baring in public what used to be considered private matters did, at least, spare audiences some tedium.
Produced in association with the Independent Television Service.``P.O.V.''
As for Ms. Makepeace's two brothers, who take up a fair amount of time _ a reclusive goat herd and an aspiring polygamist (he plans on having 20 children) _ they demonstrate that people can be unconventional yet remain uninteresting.
There is no doubting Ms. Makepeace's honesty, but watching her watch her ovaries is not exhilarating.
(``Baby, It's You'' was a Sundance Film Festival selection.)
