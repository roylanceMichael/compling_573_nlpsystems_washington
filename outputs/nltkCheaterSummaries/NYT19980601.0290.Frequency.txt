SAN FRANCISCO _ The retreat of El Nino should mean a calmer overall hurricane season for Hawaii and the tropical Pacific, but storm watchers warn the early part of the season could see a repeat of last summer's violent tropical storms.
``Based on this forecast, there may be a tendency to have an increase in the number of tropical cyclones during the early part of the hurricane season,'' said Jim Weyman, director of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.
During last summer's hurricane season, when El Nino was developing, there were nine major tropical storm systems in the central Pacific, twice the 36-year average and the fourth highest number of tropical storms during that period.
``Regardless of the number of hurricanes and tropical storms that may occur, every citizen of Hawaii should prepare for a hurricane or tropical storm because it only takes one to cause extreme devastation,'' Weyman told a briefing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa last week.
In the Atlantic and eastern Pacific east of the dateline, storms attaining sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are hurricanes; the same tropical cyclone west of the international dateline is called a typhoon.
Hurricane season runs through Nov. 15 in the eastern Pacific and through October in the central Pacific.
The record-breaking storm season for the eastern Pacific was a non-El Nino year, 1992, when 27 tropical cyclones rampaged around the ocean.
Hurricanes are more common in the eastern Pacific, with the ocean west of Mexico acting as a breeding ground for the big storms.
Monday marked the beginning of the 1998 hurricane season in the central Pacific.
Because John crossed the international dateline twice during its raucous journey, it changed status from hurricane to typhoon and back to hurricane.
