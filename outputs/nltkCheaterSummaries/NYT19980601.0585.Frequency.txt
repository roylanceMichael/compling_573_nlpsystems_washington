In losing for only the second time in 13 games, about the only things that went right for the Mets were Mike Piazza's first home run with the team, which spoiled Schmidt's bid for a shutout with two out in the eighth, and three more hits from Carlos Baerga, who is now batting .306.
But Monday night, no pitching, no defense (three errors, tying a season high) and very little hitting (just six hits off Schmidt after the Mets had 100 in the previous seven days) translated into only one thing: the Mets' first defeat in 10 games, and their first in eight with Piazza behind the plate.
Mlicki (1-4) allowed four runs, three of them earned, in six innings in a 4-3 loss to Jason Schmidt (8-1) and the Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium.
The hole Mlicki dug for them led to the end of the Mets' longest winning streak in nearly seven years and was just too deep for them to overcome, even though they rallied for three runs in the last two innings.
Over his last three starts, Mlicki has allowed 13 earned runs in 151/3 innings, with an ERA 7.63.
``He's really tough on himself, to the point of being a little ridiculous sometimes,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said before the game.
And during the last 10 days, the hitting _ bolstered immeasurably by the addition of Piazza, who has hit safely in each of his eight games with the Mets _ had been able to offset lapses in pitching.
``When the time is right for them to end,'' the manager said.
8 hitters in the Pittsburgh order to open the second inning, both scored, and the Mets were down by three runs after two innings.
That it came with Mlicki on the mound could only lead to questions about how long he would remain in the rotation.
