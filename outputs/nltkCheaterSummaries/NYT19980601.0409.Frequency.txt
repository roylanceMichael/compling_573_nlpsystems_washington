There's a lot of graceful aging going on in fashion, with no small help from Botox injections and behind-the-scenes staffs full of young, uncredited advisers.
Young designers who have received the most attention of late _ and youth is relative _ are those who have proven not that they have inventive ideas, but those who have proven they can toe the commercial line.
