When Frazier's wife took her the manuscript several years later, Gibbons says, she called her agent about the book and said ```This is going to be an extraordinary event.
I want to piece together her life because I want to know my mother as a woman.
Gibbons, more noted for her contemporary family stories, has just published ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon'' (Putnam, $22.95), which begins in 1842 with protagonist Emma Garnet chronicling her life at Seven Oaks, her father's Virginia plantation.
Gibbons touched on her mother's death in ``Ellen Foster,'' her critically acclaimed 1987 debut novel based on her traumatic childhood.
``In the book, Emma Garnet talks about livable chaos,'' Gibbons says.
Frazier's romantic odyssey about a Civil War deserter has been on best-seller lists for nearly a year.
``I knew about the high rate of infant mortality, but when I started reading women's journals, I was devastated by the constant loss that these women felt.
But ``Ellen Foster'' did not delve very deeply into her mother's life, Gibbons says.
``The Civil War presents a bottomless bounty,'' Gibbons says.
``I want to be Martha Stewart,'' says Gibbons, who lives in Raleigh with her husband, Frank Ward, and her three daughters from a previous marriage.
