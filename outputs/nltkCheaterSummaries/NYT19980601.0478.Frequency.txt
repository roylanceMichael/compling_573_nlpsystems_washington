The price of silver in the last week has dropped close to $5 an ounce, bringing it significantly below the average price of Buffett's silver purchases.
But Buffett has said his last purchase was on Jan. 12, when the price was $5.475, the lowest price of the year.
When he announced his silver investment after the close of the markets on Feb. 3, the price of silver on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange had already soared to $6.615 an ounce, 53 percent higher than it was on July 25, when Buffett began accumulating the metal.
NEW YORK _ One of the most heralded investment bets of the last year _ Warren Buffett's purchase of almost 130 million ounces of silver _ now appears to be a money loser.
Assuming he bought all 18.5 million ounces at this price, his loss on this silver is now $7.77 million.
At Monday's closing price of $5.055 an ounce, the loss is $6.35 million.
In the 1997 annual report for Berkshire Hathaway Inc., his investment vehicle, he said he had a profit of $97.4 million on his silver investment as of the end of last year.
By Feb. 17, the closing price of silver had fallen below $7 an ounce; it then bounced around between $6.50 an ounce and $6 an ounce until the beginning of May.
At the time he announced the silver purchase, Buffett said its total value amounted to less than 2 percent of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio.
Subtracting a profit of $97.4 million, leaves $568.47 million as the cost of his investment, or an average of $5.112 an ounce.
