``All we ever ask in return is all the beer we can drink, or maybe a little red wine _ you know, to get the imagination flowing,'' says Ray Guidry, described by his associates as ``the head bubba.''
``We go into some of these restaurants that call themselves Cajun, and the first thing we see is a big bottle of Tabasco on the table,'' Guidry says.
Guidry helped pioneer the ``Cajun microwave,'' so named because it's a not-so-instant and not-so-new outdoor cooking mechanism that at first impression could be mistaken for an enormous steel box.
``Or we use wood if we don't have any charcoal,'' says Robert Domingue, Guidry's colleague.
``I can guarantee that there's nothing else in the world quite like it, because I spent a lot of years experimenting to get it right,'' says Paul Benton, the inventor.
``We cooked duck gumbo and duck jambalaya _ hundreds and hundreds of pounds of duck,'' says Carrol Credeur.
Bobby Castille, a Lafayette city councilman who joined Les Bubbas several years back, elaborates: ``If the first thing you taste is pepper, it's not Cajun.
But, says Guidry, ``We love people; the closer we are to people and the more enjoyment we can bring them, the happier we are.''
``We started about 20 years ago with one pot and a lot of different ideas about ingredients,'' Guidry says.
Only Les Bubbas claim those distinctions, as I gleefully discovered at a ``duck camp feast'' in Lafayette, La.
