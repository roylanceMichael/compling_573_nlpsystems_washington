Now available in remastered fashion with the original vinyl-album packaging replicated for CD packages are ``Sinatra at the Sands,'' ``Francis Albert Sinatra &AMP; Antonio Carlos Jobim,'' ``September of My Years,'' ``Ring-A-Ding-Ding,'' ``Come Dance With Me,'' ``Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely,'' ``In the Wee Small Hours'' and ``Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!''
Not surprisingly, there's a group of re-released Frank Sinatra albums now in stores, with a second wave set for Sept. 8 by Reprise and Capitol Records.
-- Suzy Bogguss, ``Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt.''
-- Rod Stewart, ``When We Were the New Boys.''
-- ``Hope Floats'' soundtrack.
-- Master P, ``Da Last Don.''
-- Smashing Pumpkins, ``Adore.''
Preferences vary, but the title tune, ``It Was a Very Good Year'' and ``The Man in the Looking Glass'' make ``September of My Years'' _ a Grammy winner in '65 _ a superlative choice.
Other areas of pop music are fully covered this week with new releases from country, rock, alternative and rap stars expected to roll in high on the Billboard charts.
