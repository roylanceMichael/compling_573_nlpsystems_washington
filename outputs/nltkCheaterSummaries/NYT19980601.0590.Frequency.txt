NEW YORK _ Dominick Corso, a New York Civil Court judge and former city councilman, died May 23.
In 1969, he was appointed to fill an opening on the bench of the New York City Civil Court by Mayor John Lindsay and later that year was elected to a 10-year term after being nominated by both the Democratic and Republican parties.
In 1964 he formed Four Star Stage Lighting and helped build the company into a leading supplier of lighting and technical effects for Broadway productions by such producers as Hal Prince and Andrew Lloyd Webber.
He was chairman of a committee that fought, without success, to create a review board of City Council members to investigate reports of police brutality; the Police Department and Patrolmen's Benevolent Association opposed the idea.
He is survived by his wife, Lillian; two sons, Anthony of McLean, Va., and Robert of Staten Island; a daughter, Carol Ann Canapari of Glastonbury, Conn., and four grandchildren.
DeVerna began his career as a stagehand and later served as a union business agent and then as president of Local 1 of the Theatrical Protective Union.
Corso won election to the city council in 1960 and served on it for nine years, representing the Bushwick-East New York district.
He began pre-law studies at St. John's Pre-Law School and graduated from St. John's University in 1931.
