LOS ANGELES -- The news that drug makers American Home Products Corp. and Monsanto Co. will merge in a $34.4 billion stock swap has revived speculation over the future of biotechnology powerhouse Amgen.
What would make a DuPont bid plausible, said Genesis Merchant Group Securities analyst Robert LeBoyer, is that Amgen's research and development infrastructure is unmatched in the industry.
Under terms of the deal announced early Monday, American Home will exchange 1.15 shares for each Monsanto share, based on Monsanto's closing price Friday of $55.56 a share.
Prudential Securities analyst Caroline Copithorne said there is far more logic in a DuPont purchase of Amgen than similarly rumored deals in the past featuring pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Eli Lilly.
Existing drug companies like Eli Lilly already have their own sales forces and would therefore be paying at least in part for redundant personnel, Copithorne said.
The company recently agreed to pay more than $2 billion for a 50 percent stake Merck &AMP; Co. holds in a biotech joint venture the two companies formed in 1991.
A mid-May report in Business Week's ``Inside Wall Street'' column said Monsanto, along with Amgen, was a leading candidate for a takeover by chemicals giant DuPont.
With virtually no commercial biotech drug presence currently, she said, DuPont would benefit from getting Amgen's research brains and marketing brawn.
Indeed, DuPont has made clear it plans to be a major player in the biotechnology arena, with Chief Executive Officer Charles Holliday Jr. saying he expects drugs and biotechnology to account for one-third of the company's sales within five years, compared to 18 percent today.
The projected earnings growth shortfall could make institutional investors particularly receptive to a takeover offer, especially one as generous as the $25 billion -- or $95 a share -- DuPont was rumored to be considering for Amgen.
