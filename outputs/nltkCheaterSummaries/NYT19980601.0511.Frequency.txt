Eighty percent of America's 7 million small businesses (those with formal offices and fewer than 100 employees) have computers, but only about a quarter have a computer network, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm.
The network has made ``a huge, huge difference to our business,'' Frei enthused, noting that employees now share files and communicate far more effectively between offices.
And when new references came in on a prospective housekeeper or nanny, or a placement worker got important leads on new clients, word didn't always get out to employees in other offices.
After Pelton installed the network, he soon discovered another big advantage: the ease of backing up files off a single server rather than many separate computers.
When one employee updates a nanny's file, the new information is instantly available on a central computer, called a server, to everyone in the company.
Until last year, her employees had computers but mostly relied on paper files.
Pelton hired T&AMP;R Communications in Milpitas to install the network last year for under $15,000, including three computers, an uninterruptible power supply and other equipment and support.
Networks also let offices centralize files on one hard disk,so safety backups become easy and routine rather than onerous and infrequent.
Tom Pelton discovered that last year as he added employees to Micro-Metric, a San Jose firm that makes precise measurement equipment for makers of hard disks and semiconductors.
That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her to install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed.
