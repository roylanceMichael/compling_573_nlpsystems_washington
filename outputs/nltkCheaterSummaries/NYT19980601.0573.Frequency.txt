&QL;    MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Despite a healthy economy, Nassau County could be running a $30 million deficit by the end of the year if sales tax revenues continue to lag behind budget projections, the county comptroller said on Monday.
``There is a distinct possibility of significant budgetary shortfalls this year,'' and ``decisive action is warranted with regard to some key areas,'' the comptroller, Frederick Parola, said in his mid-year review of the county's $2.3 billion budget for 1998.
Parola also said the county had budgeted more than $25 million from land sales, including the sale of one parcel that that the county does not yet own.
On the positive side, Parola said the county could benefit from $10 million in unexpected investment income and a potential $17 million savings in debt service.
Expected sales tax revenues appear to be running $15 million to $20 million behind projections, he said, based on a multi-year trend and 1998 first-quarter receipts.
Revenues from Offtrack Betting could run $4 million over expectations, and recently enacted recreation fee increases could bring in an additional $1.6 million in revenue, he said.
One major sale, that of the Nassau County Medical Center and nursing home, appears to be proceeding on schedule, he said.
However, Parola warned that failure to complete this transaction would result in a $36 million shortfall.
