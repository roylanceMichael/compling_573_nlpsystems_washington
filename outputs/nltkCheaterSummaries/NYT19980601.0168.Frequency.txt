The first three batters in the Royals' lineup featured two left-handed hitters (center fielder Johnny Damon and designated hitter Hal Morris) and a switch hitter (second baseman Jose Offerman).
Sele, who last night failed in his bid to become the major leagues' first nine-game winner, surrendered home runs to two left-handed hitters during the first three innings of Baltimore's 6-3 victory at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
Surhoff and designated hitter Harold Baines, two of five players in the Orioles' lineup who hit left-handed against Sele, sent two curveballs on 400-foot journeys.
``You can't expect to give up three-run homers and expect to win very often,'' said Sele, who allowed five runs on seven hits during 32/3 innings.
Second baseman Roberto Alomar, a switch hitter, drove the Orioles' first run home with a two-out double to right field, and Baines advanced to third on the extra-base hit.
Surhoff's three-run blast consummated the Orioles' four-run first inning, and Baines connected for a one-out, solo home run during the third inning that gave the Orioles a 5-0 advantage.
``We just don't have that sustained offense right now that we've become accustomed to this year,'' Oates said.
``I buried this team early,'' Sele said after the Rangers' fifth consecutive loss and his shortest appearance this season.
``I'm just not making quality pitches,'' Sele said.
However, left-handed batters produced a .478 batting average (11-for-23) against Sele during his past two starts.
