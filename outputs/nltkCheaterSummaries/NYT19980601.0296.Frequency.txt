``Bilingual education is simply a tool for children to learn English,'' said Mary Helen Berlanga of Corpus Christi, a member of the State Board of Education.
It's as simple as that,'' said Rep. Matthew Martinez, D-Calif. ``They want to think that the only intelligent people in this world speak English.''
De La Cruz, who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1981, said he favors some bilingual education, but ``not year after year after year.''
Although bilingual programs vary widely from school to school, their general aim is to help students with limited English by offering instruction in the students' native language.
Students with limited English would be placed in English immersion classes for a year, then shifted to regular classes unless they obtained a special waiver.
The California initiative, Proposition 227, would replace bilingual education with a ``sink or swim'' approach.
As part of an effort to defeat the California proposal, Education Secretary Richard Riley recently urged schools to push students out of bilingual education after three years.
If the schools don't teach English, their kids don't have a chance,'' said Alice Callaghan, who runs Las Familias del Pueblo, a storefront community center that served as boycott headquarters.
Although both sides in the dispute agree that a repudiation of bilingual education in California would give bilingual critics new momentum, no one expects an immediate rollback of bilingual education in other states.
``The political momentum is going our way,'' said Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of English First.
