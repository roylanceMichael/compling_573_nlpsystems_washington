Now in bookstores nationwide, the Sugar Busters diet _ high on protein, low on carbohydrates _ was designed by a vascular surgeon, two gastroenterologists and an oilman in New Orleans.
The immediate weight loss on a high-protein diet is water loss, said Dr. Margo Denke of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas.
``Evidence accumulated in the 1970s documents the fact that if you restrict carbohydrates and increase protein, you promote the loss of body water and salt,'' Denke said.
The problem, Gollman says, is that you can't stay healthy on this diet for the long haul because it has too much protein and not enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.
The Atkins diet was launched in 1972 with the publication of ``Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution.''
Atkins is still specializing in diet and nutrition as medical director of The Atkins Center for Complimentary Medicine in New York City.
``The Atkins diet has been revived,'' said Barbara Gollman, a Dallas dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.
The promise of low-carbohydrate diets zeros in on the fact that the body first uses carbohydrates (sugars and starches) for its basic energy needs, because they are quickly and easily turned into the glucose needed to sustain life.
If the body doesn't immediately need the glucose, it is stored as fat until blood-sugar levels get low and it is needed.
Some of the best restaurants in New Orleans, including Commander's Palace, now serve Sugar Busters specials _ such as a large pork chop on a small mountain of sweet potatoes pureed with spicy sausage and nestled on a lake of spinach, sauteed with bacon.
