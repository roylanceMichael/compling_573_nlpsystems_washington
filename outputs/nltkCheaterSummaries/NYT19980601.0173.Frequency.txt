But while the Stars peppered Osgood with five shots, they couldn't score on a power play that is 0-for-22 in three games against the Red Wings and has just two goals in its past 11 playoff games.
The crowd at The Joe was never any louder in the game than it was after the Wings killed the five-on-three, and it was just three minutes later that the Red Wings scored on their own power play to take a 2-0 lead.
The Stars seemed to have control of the game, despite the 1-0 deficit and had a golden opportunity to tie the score when Wings defenseman Larry Murphy took his first penalty of the playoffs to give the Stars a five-on-three power play for 1 minute, 34 seconds.
Lidstrom sneaked another point shot past Belfour in the second period, followed by a long shot from the stick of defenseman Jamie Macoun to give the Wings a 4-0 lead just 25:33 into the game.
``I think we can play aggressively, we just can't make the mistakes we made,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said.
``We can play aggressive, we just can't make those mistakes,'' center Guy Carbonneau said.
DETROIT _ The Stars decided to take an aggressive game to the Joe Louis Arena ice last night and make the Detroit Red Wings react.
The Stars played firehouse hockey from the opening drop, pushing the play at Detroit and trying to prove they weren't intimidated by either the crowd or the Red Wings.
``Our power play took some energy away from our game.''
Hitchcock said afterward the comeback was indicative of the way the team played, adding that ``from a five-on-five standpoint, that's the best we've played all playoffs.''
