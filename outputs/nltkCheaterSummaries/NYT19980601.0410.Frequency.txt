Rice, who injured the knee twice last season and played in only two games, is expected to be at full strength when training camp begins in July.
Frank Pollack, the team's only proven reserve at the position, recently underwent surgery to repair a disk in his back and won't be able to practice until late July at the earliest.
Pollack's injury leaves the 49ers with two experienced tackles for this camp _ starters Derrick Deese and Jamie Brown.
``We're trying to progress with certain situations we haven't practiced yet _ short-yardage, goal line, nickel and dime _ so when we come to training camp it will be review.
The wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers has been working out regularly and underwent a minor operation earlier last month to remove screws from his damaged left knee.
Former tackle Harris Barton, who missed all of last season with a bad knee, is expected to play guard this season.
``Jerry's doing well, but he'll be very limited,'' Mariucci said.
Joining Pollack on the sidelines for this camp will be free safety Merton Hanks, who still is recovering from surgery to repair a torn chest muscle.
SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Rice won't be doing much this week besides ensuring his knee is progressing back to full strength.
Mariucci also is pleased with the progress that defensive end Gabe Wilkins is making with his rehabilitation from knee surgery.
