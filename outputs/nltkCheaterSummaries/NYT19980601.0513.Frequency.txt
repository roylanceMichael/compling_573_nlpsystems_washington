In an effort to trim their payroll, the Giants had considered releasing Miller, who has started 71 games for the team at linebacker, including 14 games last season.
After the workout of veteran and rookie players Monday at Giants Stadium, Fassel said he expected the team would soon have an announcement on Miller's status.
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The contract impasse between the Giants and linebacker Corey Miller will end Tuesday when Miller signs a restructured deal that calls for a substantial pay cut from the $1.5 million he was scheduled to make next season.
But with the Giants scanning the waiver wire this week for quality veterans cast aside by other teams in payroll purges, Miller's position with the Giants grew more tenuous.
As with any player, the Giants could still cut Miller before the season begins and not have to pay his base salary.
Miller's value dropped this winter when the Giants re-signed linebacker Marcus Buckley.
Buckley, however, is inexperienced as an every-down player, and the Giants had hoped to keep Miller, who is one of the more senior players on the team.
Miller, 29, was not at Monday's workout, but Fassel said Miller was expected to attend a team workout on Tuesday.
``We've had discussions for the last several months on a possible restructuring,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said.
Coach Jim Fassel and his assistant coaches think Buckley can be the starter at Miller's strongside linebacking position.
