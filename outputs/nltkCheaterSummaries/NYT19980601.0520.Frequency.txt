Kennett said the company did ``actively support NATO enlargement,'' but ``for all the right reasons,'' which he said included a peaceful Europe.
WASHINGTON _ The Boeing Co., now the nation's second largest defense contractor, has vaulted into first place in a defense industry category that really matters in Washington, D.C.: campaign contributions.
That contention was rejected by Boeing spokesman Douglas Kennett, who said the company contributed to the two Senate campaign committees at the end of April because that's when the committees were holding fundraisers.
``We actively support events held by both parties, and that money was for contribution and attendance at events,'' Kennett said.
Boeing spokesman John Dern said ``the safety of the commercial transport industry is excellent, and the FAA, as the primary regulatory body, has a lot to be proud of in that regard.''
``The failure of the aviation industry to fix identified safety problems, with the tacit consent of Congress, is easily the most striking discovery of our investigation,'' Lewis said.
The report argued that the contributions were part of defense industry campaign to win NATO enlargement so the companies could sell more military equipment to those countries.
Another report, by the Center for Public Integrity, argued that the nation's aviation interests, including Boeing, have been laxly regulated because they have given more than $43.8 million to congressional campaigns since 1987.
The Center for Public Integrity's executive director, Charles Lewis, was chosen Monday for a prestigious ``genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation.
Boeing officially has been the second largest defense contractor since March, when the Pentagon announced that the company had received $9.6 million in prime military contract work for fiscal 1997.
