It's a sharp satire that _ under the guidance of director Peter Weir (``Gallipoli,'' ``Witness,'' ``Dead Poets Society'') and with an energetic but smartly tempered comic-dramatic performance by Carrey _ is easily one of the most thought-provoking movies of the year.
The ``brilliant script'' is now ``The Truman Show,'' which opens Friday.
``The kind of public torture of Lady Diana and her husband (Prince Charles) was really a version of `The Truman Show,''' says the Australian director.
``I think at the very base of it, there's a human goodness,'' Carrey says.
If there were a real ``Truman Show'' on TV, would Carrey watch it?
``After everything that happens to this guy (Truman), you can't kill the human spirit,'' Carrey says.
``Every one of us,'' Carrey says, ``has at one point in our lives felt that feeling.
It's a warning,'' Carrey says.
Like all good satire, ``The Truman Show'' entertains while illuminating a serious aspect of contemporary society.
``What if I was the only real person and everyone else was an actor?,'' Carrey says, completely serious.
