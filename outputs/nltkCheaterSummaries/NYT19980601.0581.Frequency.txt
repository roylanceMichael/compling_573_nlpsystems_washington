But the defendant's lawyer, William Tendy, said the police had picked up the wrong man and carefully rebutted each point raised by the prosecution, in particular asking how Anthony Williams could have said his father shot him if the boy had a mouth full of shattered teeth.
In his opening statement, Assistant District Attorney Edward Whitesell told the jury that Dalkeith McIntosh, 38, had committed a ``final act of domestic violence'' on Aug. 12, 1996.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., _ On the opening day of New York's second death penalty trial, a police officer testified that a 6-year-old boy had implicated his father in a double homicide.
Part of McIntosh's motivation, the prosecutor said, was to prevent Mrs. Williams from testifying against him in a pending assault case and to make sure there would be no witnesses to her death.
McIntosh, he said, had shot his estranged wife, Francine Williams, 47, twice in the head that day as she sat in the idling car on a secluded street here.
Officer Gregory Wagler described finding the boy, Anthony Williams, crying and screaming that his father had shot him as he sat in the back seat of a car.
But jurors had already heard in Whitesell's opening statement that the murder weapon was missing in a swampy area for nearly a year after the shootings, and that exposure could have altered its coloring.
``And you will see the danger of convicting someone _ let alone killing someone _ based on the evidence you are going to hear.''
If the jury finds McIntosh guilty of first-degree murder, it will then decide on his punishment _ death by lethal injection or life in prison without possibility of parole.
Whitesell said McIntosh then turned his gun on the boy, who survived being shot in the face.
