``There are hints that there may be some fertile ground to plow,'' especially in allegations that Lindsey may have ``coached'' witnesses before they testified to the Starr grand jury, Gray said.
Lindsey, a White House deputy counsel, has coordinated much of the administration's response to allegations that Clinton had a sexual liaison with former White House intern Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it.
If the high court agrees, that would delay a final ruling until next fall or winter at the soonest whether Lindsey must answer Starr's questions that the White House has refused to let him answer.
``Bruce Lindsey may know a great deal,'' said C. Boyden Gray, former White House counsel in the Bush administration.
Critics of the White House said Clinton's decision was based on a desire to delay Starr's probe.
The 8th U.S. Court of Appeals last year rejected a claim of confidentiality for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's conversations with government lawyers after her appearance before Starr's grand jury.
WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision Monday to focus on the attorney-client privilege to prevent a key aide's testimony could substantially delay the unraveling of the Monica Lewinsky matter.
Although Clinton abandoned his defense of executive privilege in briefs sent to the Supreme Court, he dug in on efforts to shield his closest confidant, Bruce Lindsey, from having to answer crucial questions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
``The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out,'' said White House counsel Charles Ruff said.
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, in an opinion that cites secret information, has already ruled that Lindsey must answer Starr's questions.
