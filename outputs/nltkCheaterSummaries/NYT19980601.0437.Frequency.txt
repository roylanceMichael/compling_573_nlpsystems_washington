Two weeks ago, Mandela sent his defense minister to Zambia on a shuttle diplomacy mission between Kaunda and Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba, a South African government representative said.
Kaunda was arrested on Christmas Day and accused of being behind a brief coup on Oct. 28 in which army officers led by a ``Captain Solo'' invaded the house of the army chief of staff and the national radio station.
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Kenneth Kaunda, the former president of Zambia, was set free on Monday after prosecutors dropped charges that he had a role in a botched coup attempt last year.
The only evidence it made public against him was an interview he gave shortly before the coup in which he said there would soon be ``an explosion'' in Zambia.
He was apparently released released in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, as part of a deal brokered by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, whom he thanked in brief remarks on the steps of the courthouse while hundreds of cheering supporters crowded around him.
He said at the courthouse on Monday that ``nothing can stop me'' from pursuing his campaign against Chiluba.
Kaunda's lawyer, Sakwiba Sikota, said on Monday that the release was ``a bit of a letdown.''
Under Zambian law, the prosecution reserved the right to resurrect the charges later, but Sikota said that ``seemed unlikely.''
At considerable risk of attack by apartheid South Africa, he allowed the African National Congress to keep its headquarters in Lusaka while it was in exile.
But in a later speech outside the headquarters of his United National Independence Party, he said he was calling a party congress to elect a new leader.
