CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ With some difficulty, the Russians regained steering control of their drifting Mir space station Monday, satisfying NASA that it was safe to proceed with a final U.S. shuttle visit.
Early Monday, the station crew switched the computer to a backup motion sensor and succeeded in folding in the station's steering jets.
At midday Monday, Mir cosmonauts Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin and their flight control team in suburban Moscow managed to restart the station's steering system after two days of slow but uncontrolled drift.
``Let's hope I can find my boarding pass,'' Thomas joked as he spoke with NASA colleagues at the Russian ground control facility.
``The situation is basically under control, there is no reason to delay,'' said Boris Sotnikov, the Russian manager for the cooperative program.
The station remained drenched in sunlight, and there was little power loss to the Mir's life support systems.
Without steering control, Mir is technically in a tumble and in jeopardy of losing its ability to generate electrical power.
The loss of steering control is the first for the station since early January.
We will launch when both the Mir and shuttle are ready and safe to go.''
The Russians planned to wean the station from the jets to the gyrodynes Tuesday.
