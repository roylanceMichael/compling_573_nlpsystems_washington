That's not surprising in Chiapas, where many people have a deep mistrust of the government and where the Zapatista rebels staged a revolt in January 1994, decrying what they said was long-standing mistreatment by the government and the state's large landholders.
The government has blamed the farmers and ranchers for starting the fires, which have scorched thousands of acres of sensitive rain forest in the Chimalapas region west of here and have contributed to the choking smoke that fills the valleys of Chiapas and has blown north to Texas and beyond.
It's too bad that things are burning, but there's no other way to prepare the land.
When agricultural fires jump out of the fields and into the forest, often the farmers and ranchers don't alert the government, Garcia said.
``Almost nobody in this area is burning,'' Hernandez, 48, said as young turkeys pecked at the dirt at his feet.
The blackened fields dotting the mountains on the eastern edge of the rain forest show that few communities are following Cuauhtemoc in its self-imposed burning ban.
But government environmental officials also have said they realize there is no way to stop agricultural burning, and until this year, there has been little incentive to try.
Thousands of tiny communities like this are scattered across the state of Chiapas, places where families grow maize and coffee and graze cattle on steep hillsides, using ancient slash-and-burn methods to prepare the soil for planting or to coax grasses out of the ground.
``After we finished working, we got on our horses and went out using machetes and rakes to clear away the dry layer of vegetation on the jungle floor.''
He's a little annoyed that the government says agricultural burning started the fires.
