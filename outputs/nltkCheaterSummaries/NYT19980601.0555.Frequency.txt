ATLANTA _ Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a former Emory University business professor who lost an appointment at the Georgia Institute of Technology after Emory officials accused him of vandalism, has filed a lawsuit charging Emory with trumping up charges against him and sabotaging his career.
William Chace, Emory's president, then told Georgia Tech's president, G. Wayne Clough, about the developments, and Georgia Tech rescinded its offer on Dec. 3, according to the lawsuit.
But in an exchange of letters with Sonnenfeld's lawyer earlier this year, Emory's general counsel, Joseph Crooks, brushed off the professor's claims.
But before the state Board of Regents could approve the $200,000-a-year appointment, Emory officials informed their Georgia Tech counterparts that a security camera at Emory's Goizueta School of Business had captured Sonnenfeld defacing a wall as he walked down a hallway on Nov. 26.
Sonnenfeld's lawsuit charges Emory and various university officials with slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, deprivation of due process rights, and tortious interference with his business dealings.
Because Sonnenfeld was considered an academic star who had won acclaim for his teaching and for the creation of an educational institute for chief executives, his appointment was widely seen as a coup for Georgia Tech.
A copy of the videotape, which Sonnenfeld said was provided to his lawyer by Emory officials, shows the professor zigzagging down the hallway, apparently kicking the walls lightly as he goes.
Last September, Georgia Tech said that it had lured Sonnenfeld away from its wealthier crosstown rival to become dean of its Dupree School of Management.
``It wouldn't be an audition for the Atlanta Ballet,'' he said earlier this year, while watching the videotape.
In the lawsuit filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Sonnenfeld seeks reappointment to his tenured teaching position and unspecified monetary damages.
