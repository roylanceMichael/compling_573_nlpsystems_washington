PYLA, Cyprus _ On an island divided by concertina wire and hatred, this may be the only village where ethnic Greeks and Turks live side by side and manage to get along.
Across the road at the Greek cafe, Yambos Pavlo peered out over sunglasses and said, ``It's not that Turks and Greeks can't live together.
Cyprus has been divided into rival ethnic Turkish and Greek Cypriot zones since 1974, when Turkey invaded the northern third of the island in response to a short-lived coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece.
Most observers say the glue that holds Pyla together is the British military base, where many of the villagers work.
Here both Greeks and Turks duck out of the hot Cypriot sun to join the British soldiers for drinks after a day of work.
Hasan Mehmet, 70, sat looking out over the stucco arches of the Turkish coffee house sipping a small cup of black and powerful Turkish coffee.
It's the question everyone asks,'' says Michael Diffily, a Dublin police detective who is now on a military tour with the United Nations post in Pyla.
And Greeks and Turks work together.
``The base has something to do with why people here get along,'' said a British officer who has been stationed here for 10 years.
And on the only main road is a Turkish mosque, with its Ottoman minaret, and a Greek church, with its red-tiled steeple.
