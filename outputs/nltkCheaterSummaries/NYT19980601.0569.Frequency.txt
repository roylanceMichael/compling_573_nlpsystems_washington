In the long, nasty quarrel that followed, a judge ruled in March that the conservancy's deeds were worthless and said Ms. Pardini and Fink could sue for fraud.
LaBudde said he ``never had any suspicion'' the land was owned by Ms. Pardini and Fink.
But in an affidavit in the Fink-Pardini case, Mary Lue, who eventually remarried Wilbur Smith as his third wife, said Van Valkenburgh and the conservancy's counsel, Robert Anderberg, ``misled and tricked me and my husband'' into accepting $5,000.
Poking around in deeds for land the conservancy might buy up for preservation, he wrote a letter in 1994 to Smith's first wife, Mary Lue, telling her ``it may come as a surprise,'' but she still owned 30 acres of Fink-Pardini land.
At bottom, Fink and Ms. Pardini accuse the conservancy of trying to steal their land by tactics more fitting a real estate operator than an upright environmental group.
The group produced two unorthodox deeds that, it argued, proved that it now had possession of almost half of the land Fink and Ms. Pardini thought they owned.
Although Kelder and Hagen admit they had only a sketchy idea of where their land was, they spent 13 years hunting and cutting wood on the property without protests, never realizing it was owned first by the dude ranch and then by Ms. Pardini and Fink.
``Everybody knew it was our property,'' Fink said in a recent interview.
Van Valkenburgh, a former director of lands and forests for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, has a crusty appreciation of land disputes, writing mystery novels about such conflicts with titles like ``Murder in the Catskills.''
Van Valkenburgh said, ``How did I know it was a clerical error?''
