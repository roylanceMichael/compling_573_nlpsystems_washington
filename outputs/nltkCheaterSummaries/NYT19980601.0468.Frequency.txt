The defeat of Momir Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party, financed and backed by Milosevic, means that Belgrade will now have to use other means, perhaps a state of emergency, to keep Montenegro from drifting toward secession, Western diplomats said.
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro celebrated his governing coalition's sweeping victory in crucial parliamentary elections on Monday, ensuring his domination of a government that will defy integration with Serbia.
With 94 percent of the vote in Sunday's elections counted, the Montenegrin Election Commission said the coalition led by Djukanovic had taken 49.5 percent of the vote.
``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,'' Djukanovic, 36, told cheering supporters outside Government House, adding:    ``This is not our final victory.
The Serbian and Montenegrin Parliaments send an equal number of legislators to the upper house of the federal Parliament, although Montenegro has only 650,000 people to Serbia's 10.5 million.
Bulatovic's Socialists won 36.07 percent, and the Liberal Alliance, which openly calls for secession, won 6 percent, with the balance split between smaller parties.
The governing coalition is expected to get about 40 seats in Parliament, with about 30 for Bulatovic's Socialists.
Milosevic's governing Socialists, however, have a substantial majority in the lower house.
Bulatovic, however, said on Monday that his party was not satisfied with the ``mechanisms of electoral control.''
They said tactics like Belgrade's decision not to pay pensions to those living in Montenegro, a refusal to include Djukanovic in the federal government and the sealing of the borders with neighboring Croatia to thwart trade, would continue and perhaps be stepped up.
