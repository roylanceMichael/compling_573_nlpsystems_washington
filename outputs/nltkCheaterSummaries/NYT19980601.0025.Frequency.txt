``Godzilla's'' performance was also hampered by solid competition from Paramount's fourth weekend of ``Deep Impact'' with $10.1 million at 3,280 theaters, boosting its 24-day take to $112 million, and Disney's third weekend of ``The Horse Whisperer'' with $7.3 million at 2,189 sites.
Warner's third weekend of ``The Quest for Camelot'' finished eighth with $2.3 million at 2,449 theaters, followed by Paramount's 24th weekend of ``Titanic'' with $1.73 million at 1,562 theaters.
Overall business was ahead of the same weekend last year as rival releases posted relatively strong numbers, led by 20th Century Fox's opening of Sandra Bullock's ``Hope Floats'' with $14.7 million at 2,367 theaters.
Steven Spielberg's dino-sequel eventually took in $229 million domestically while ``Godzilla's'' final U.S. gross is likely to come in around $150 million, half what many forecasters expected before the opening.
Miramax's ``I Got the Hook-Up,'' starring rapper Master P in a comedy about phone scams, opened respectably in sixth with $3.4million at 655 theaters, followed by Warner Bros.' debut of the late Chris Farley's last film, ``Almost Heroes,'' with a disappointing $2.8 million at 2,048 theaters.
LOS ANGELES _ The monster lizard again failed to deliver monster ticket sales as the second weekend of ``Godzilla'' took in an estimated $18 million at 3,310 theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
Business for ``Godzilla'' had been expected to fall quickly but its 59 percent decline from its opening Friday-Sunday was significantly steeper than last year's 53 percent fall for ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' during the same weekend.
``Titanic'' edged Universal's second weekend of ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' with a downbeat $1.6 million at 1,130 locations.
Warren Beatty's ``Bulworth'' finished fifth with a moderate $5 million at 2,051 sites in its second weekend of nationwide release by 20th Century Fox.
``The `Godzilla' results are very soft for the second weekend and it looks like there's no repeat business,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica.
