``It's something, in general terms, that you might consider internally,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who broached Nomo's name during a discussion about other pitchers with a reporter before Monday night's game against the Pirates.
After having his four-year major league career take a drastic turn, Nomo might feel cozy with the Mets because Bobby Valentine managed in Japan, pitcher Masato Yoshii is his best friend, Mike Piazza is his former catcher and Dave Wallace, a senior adviser for the Mets, was Nomo's coach with the Dodgers.
``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps all teams,'' Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said.
The New York Mets expressed interest in obtaining Nomo, while the New York Yankees said they might also be interested in the 29-year-old right-hander, who was designated for assignment and removed from Los Angeles' 40-man roster.
The Los Angeles Dodgers Monday abruptly ended their relationship with Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who helped revitalize interest in major-league baseball in 1995 with his corkscrew delivery, but this year had pitched terribly, grew disenchanted and requested a trade.
This is the second major move by the Fox Group, which bought the Dodgers from the O'Malley's two months ago and traded Mike Piazza as part of a seven-player deal last month.
This decision almost certainly reduces Nomo's trade value because teams know Los Angeles has a deadline by which to move him.
``I would like to think trades are inevitable in this business,'' Yoshii said.
``The Dodgers designated him for assignment?''
Nomo barely spoke during a news conference in Los Angeles, saying he ``definitely needed a change of scenery, a change of environment.''
