Madrid, who authored the ``Media and Campaign Strategy for the California Latino Voter,'' said in his report that the greatest number of Latino votes can be garnered by utilizing English speaking media, supplemented by a secondary effort in Spanish media.
``We truly believe Latinos are so key for the future of California and will be even more important as we move into the 21st century,'' said Kathy Checchi, who has appeared in numerous commercials telling voters in Spanish about her husband's strong Italian immigrant roots.
And showing just how serious he is about speaking directly to Latino voters, Checchi opened Get Out the Vote offices in 12 Latino neighborhoods throughout the state.
According to the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, there were 1.35 million registered Latino voters in the state 10 years ago.

He points to a Latino Issues Forum survey done earlier this year by political scientist Fernando Guerra that found only 18 percent of the Latino electorate is likely to get their news from Spanish-language media.
The voter guides are part of an ``unprecedented'' effort to communicate the message that the Coalition and Latino Catholic voters share many of the same values, the group said.
``In the old days, voters didn't watch Spanish television,'' said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, a nonpartisan group in Montebello.
This year, Latinos are likely to make up 13 percent of the California electorate, up from 7 percent in 1990, he said.
``It's a bigger return for your money and it's significant enough of the electorate that you're willing to have separate campaign strategies,'' said Rodriguez.
