``Rather than committing himself to do the hard work necessary to end the minority undercount, the president is out peddling statistical snake oil to the public that will add millions of `virtual people' in some areas while subtracting millions of real people from other areas,'' Miller said.
``There's no question that the newest Americans, the ones we most need to learn about, are the hardest ones to find,'' said Stephen Klineberg, professor of sociology at Rice University and director of the annual Houston Area Survey.
``Accuracy is critically important because America is in the process of rapid social change and rapid demographic change and only the census gives a meaningful picture of what's actually happening,'' Klineberg said.
``I thought the idea of a census was accuracy and it turns out it's politics,'' Klineberg said.
``The partisan calculations of political science are driving the Clinton administration census sampling scheme,'' Miller said.
``Our goal is the most accurate census using the most up-to-date scientific methods and the best technology with the most cost-effective use of taxpayer dollars,'' Lewis said.
Republican Party officials fear statistical sampling, which would add more low-income people who traditionally vote Democratic, could cost them as many as 24 House seats and 400 seats in state legislatures.
``This is by far going to be the most controversial census ever,'' said a Republican staff member involved in the battle.
Houston was chosen as the venue for Clinton's first remarks on the topic, Lewis said, because the city had a big undercount of Hispanics.
At issue is the Census Bureau plan, developed by the National Academy of Sciences, to use a statistical sampling, rather than an actual hard count, of 10 percent of the population to project the number of people who fail to respond either by mail or to personal contact.
