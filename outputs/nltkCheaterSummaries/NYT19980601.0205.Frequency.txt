According to a report just published by the Council on Competitiveness, a private, nonpartisan policy forum in Washington, there is ``an acute skills shortage in every part of the country that threatens the foundation of American competitiveness.''
``In the coming years,'' the council says, ``new entrants to the work force will present an even tougher challenge: They are projected to be the least prepared and the most ethnically, racially, and gender diverse in history.''

Unfortunately, according to the Council on Competitiveness, the United States has an aging work force and a youth population that is ``largely unprepared'' for highly skilled work.
Many people in business believe the shortage threatens not just the current economic expansion but America's continuing domination of the computer and software technologies that will be crucial to prosperity in the 21st century.
A senior Labor Department official likes to point out that nearly half of America's high school graduates do not have the math skills necessary to get a job in a modern auto plant.
But there is also widespread agreement among experts that the American school system is not good enough at teaching the skills needed by industry, nor at inculcating the ambition to excel in science and math.
More and more companies, particularly those using the most advanced technologies, say they are cutting back expansion plans _ or transferring some operations abroad _ because they simply cannot find enough workers with the requisite skills in the United States.
Seen from this angle, a better way of putting the question might be: How long can a country whose high school students score so poorly in mathematics and science hope to retain world technological leadership?
The chances are you will be told that the Achilles' heel of America's economic performance is a growing shortage of skilled labor.
