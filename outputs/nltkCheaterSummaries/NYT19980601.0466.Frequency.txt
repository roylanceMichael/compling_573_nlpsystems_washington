New engines would reduce the cost per flying hour by up to one-third, and the cost of operating the engine would be one-tenth of the current cost, Lockheed officials said.
While the two contracts could mean significant business for Lockheed, they probably won't require additional employees, Crockett said.
ATLANTA _ Lockheed Martin is vying for a multibillion-dollar project to upgrade the military's C-5 heavy transport jets, a contract that could mean continued stability for Lockheed and its 10,000 workers.
U.S. Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia, speaking Monday at a Cobb County Chamber of Commerce breakfast, said Lockheed is seeking two government contracts to modernize the C-5's electronics and engines.
It is much cheaper to replace engines and communications systems than to replace cargo jets, Crockett said.
But reliability, maintenance and operating costs could ground the plane if changes aren't made to update the engines and electronics, the Air Force said.
The C-5, the military's largest cargo jet, is flown all over the world every day, said Jim Grant, Lockheed director of airlift marketing.
Lockheed spokesman Ray Crockett said the company's main competitor is Raytheon of Waco, Texas.
The second phase would replace the C-5 engines at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $5 billion.
The electronics would be Honeywell systems and the engines would be General Electric.
