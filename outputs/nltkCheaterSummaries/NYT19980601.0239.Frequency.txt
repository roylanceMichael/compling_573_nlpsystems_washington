WASHINGTON    CLINTON-PRIVILEGE _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision to limit his legal appeals to his assertion of attorney-client privilege in the Monica Lewinsky matter could yield two advantages: reducing th case to make it seem too minor for the Supreme Court to take on an expedited schedule, and limiting questioning of Bruce Lindsey, the Clinton confidant and director of damage control.
It took CIGNA a month to reach that decision and another month to review Branham's appeal, even though its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical technique.
Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Branham's husband, Craig, has the right to sue CIGNA because a company clause requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and therefore non-binding.
