The motif of ``The Dying Gaul'' is loss, as it is observed from neutral corners, whether by Robert's psychiatrist, Foss (Robert Emmet Lunney), trying to help Robert over Malcolm's death; by Elaine, absorbing Robert's suffering while surfing the Net; and even by Robert, a writer whose screenplay about his relationship with Malcolm, ``The Dying Gaul,'' is named for the Greek sculpture of the Gallic warrior, frozen in pain and defeat.
The scenes in which Robert and Elaine communicate by computer _ scenes that carry echoes of ``Closer,'' a play by Patrick Marber about the hollow lives of four Londoners, that transferred to the West End after a sold-out run at the National Theater last fall _ are easily the most engrossing and disturbing in ``The Dying Gaul.''
Lucas, who in ``Prelude to a Kiss'' displayed a lyrical gift for stories blending romance and the occult, walks a decidedly darker path in ``The Dying Gaul,'' a minor tantrum of a play about the kind of black grief that can mutate into bottomless rage.
Robert, played by Tim Hopper, still deep in mourning over his dead lover Malcolm, takes up with Jeffrey (Tony Goldwyn), a bisexual Hollywood producer married to Elaine (Linda Emond), who is aware of Jeffrey's infidelity and is desperate to understand the nature of his passion.
NEW YORK _ If there is any act more vicious than the hoax perpetrated against Robert, the tormented hero of Craig Lucas' tortured new play, ``The Dying Gaul,'' it might be labeled a psychic atrocity.
Robert, played by Hopper with an air of abject despair bordering on panic, submits ``The Dying Gaul'' script to Jeffrey, a hotshot-producer type familiar from a hundred other plays.
Out of all these vacant relationships, Robert and Jeffrey, Jeffrey and Elaine, Elaine and Robert, comes a hostile conclusion that makes Robert seem smaller and more embittered than one could possibly have been prepared for.
``I am spirit without body _ your guardian,'' Elaine says, chipping away at Robert's defenses until he reveals more about his love, and his lovers, than is good for either of them.
``The Dying Gaul'' is the somber epilogue to a love foreshortened by death.
With: Tim Hopper (Robert), Tony Goldwyn (Jeffrey), Linda Emond (Elaine) and Robert Emmet Lunney (Foss).
