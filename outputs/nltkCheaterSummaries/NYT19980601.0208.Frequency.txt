Taccone acknowledged that McNally's play was not likely to premiere in Berkeley and even said the playwright wasn't his ``cup of tea entirely,'' but he said the show of solidarity was important.
And until MTC artistic director Lynne Meadow held a press conference Thursday, no one charging the theater with ``censorship'' knew the details of the threats that led her to cancel the play.
``You can't let these people win,'' Berkeley Rep Artistic Director Tony Taccone said of those who issued the anonymous threats.
Before the reinstatement, offers by Reinis, the Berkeley Repertory Theatre and the Eureka Theatre to produce the play in the Bay Area symbolized the theater community's vigilance when it comes to freedom of expression.
Ignorance played as big a role as passion in the ``Corpus Christi'' affair, which left the MTC scraping egg from its blushing face, turned the playwright into a unwitting hero of artistic freedom, and raised all sorts of fears that intimidation could be a successful strategy to influence what gets seen and what doesn't on stage.
``It's very easy for both sides to judge,'' said Carey Perloff, artistic director of the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco.
A Catholic group disavowed the threats of violence but strongly protested the play.
Last week's firestorm over the cancellation and subsequent reinstatement of Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi'' at New York's Manhattan Theater Club was felt strongly across the country.
Tony Kushner, Wendy Wasserstein and a host of other big-gun playwrights decried MTC's original decision to cancel the play.
``The play will probably open and get creamed by the critics,'' he said, ``and be a huge hit with the public.''
