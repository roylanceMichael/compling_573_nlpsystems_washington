In the book Reeve details the high points of his life since the accident, including his electrifying surprise appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1996 and his stint as director of the critically acclaimed HBO film ``In the Gloaming.''
In ``Still Me'' (Random House, $25), Reeve writes movingly about his accident, which occurred three years ago, and its aftermath.
His injuries were so serious that, upon being told by doctors he had a slim chance for survival, his mother begged them to ``pull the plug'' and withdraw life support.
``When two people have to roll you back and forth in order to put on your underpants at age 45, it's a difficult lesson in patience and acceptance,'' he writes.
``For more than a year I wondered if the injury was purely an accident or if I was responsible for what happened,'' he writes.
``And for the first time since the accident I laughed.''
When doing publicity for the first Superman movie, Reeve defined a hero as ``someone who commits a courageous action without considering the consequences.''
He stopped wondering, ``What life do I have?''
and began to consider, ``What life can I build?''
He writes that he now thinks of a hero as ``an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.''
