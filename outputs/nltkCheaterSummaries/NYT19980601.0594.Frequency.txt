Members of Congress also have questioned the circumstances of Williams' arrest in Ecuador in September 1996, a month after a Drug Enforcement Administration official told his counterparts in Ecuador that Williams was part of Castrillon's alleged drug ring.
WASHINGTON _ Jim Williams, the St. Simons Island, Ga. native who has been in jail in Ecuador for 20 months, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida on charges he was part of a cocaine smuggling operation, according to an indictment made public Monday.
``We begged them to indict Jim because we thought it was the only way to get a fair trial,'' Charlie Williams, a St. Simons Island restaurateur and brother of Jim Williams, said.
Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), one of several members of Congress who have questioned Williams' treatment in Ecuador, said the indictment should lead to his extradition.
It described an alleged drug trafficking and money laundering ring led by Jose Castrillon, a Colombian from whom Williams bought fish for his Jacksonville, Fla. importing company.
Williams, whose cause has been taken up by former President Jimmy Carter and members of Congress, was named in three counts of a six-count indictment.
``In the U.S., he would receive a fair and timely trial,'' Kingston said.
His family in Georgia welcomed the news as a glimmer of hope that he soon would return to the United States, even if it is to stand trial.
Williams' wife, Robin, said he was arrested in Ecuador to pressure him to testify against Castrillon.
The grand jury in Tampa, Fla. also indicted Castrillon and 14 other people.
