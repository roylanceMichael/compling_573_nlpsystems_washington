As the championship coordinator for the 1998 U.S. Open, to be played at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, Barker worried aloud about the need for bigger tents in case of rain.
Fleming said the plan was for the rough to be at 5 inches when the tournament begins, but ``all it takes is a good rain and two to three days of not being able to mow, and you're up to 7.
SAN FRANCISCO _ During a particularly wicked rainstorm at last year's U.S. Open in Bethesda, Md., shelter was at a premium.
According to Tim Moraghan, the USGA's agronomist for championships, continued rains can make the rough difficult to trim, and rough that is too tall has a tendency to lay over.
The wet weather has hampered some construction around the course, though United States Golf Association championship manager Steve Worthy said rain was more an ``annoyance'' than anything else.
The June 18-21 tournament is nigh and, strange as it seems, Barker's concerns don't seem so far-fetched anymore.
It never rains in San Francisco in June,''' Barker said.
``And once you mow it, if you don't mow it when it's relatively dry, it just clumps up.''
Never, ever worry about that in San Francisco.
``This is just amazing to all of us,'' Barker said Thursday as El Nino dropped another day of rain on the Bay area.
