Yet for all its pre-emptive self-awareness, ``Labor Day'' keeps popping in elements that might have come from a generic Gurney play kit, most notably a romantic entanglement that triggers the denouement and is reminiscent of Lady Chatterly-like situations discussed in both his early ``Children'' and ``The Cocktail Hour.''
John winces (quite rightly) at the idea of ``closure,'' and in response to Dennis' proposed alternative ending, which could involve either Rwanda or the Pacific Rim, he answers testily, ``And I'll top it all off with a profoundly moving speech about the Holocaust.''
Even as ``Labor Day'' makes fun of Dennis' theatrical trendiness, it acknowledges that such trends do reflect real changes in society and even close to home.
Set in John's converted chicken coop of a studio (attractively realized by Ralph Funicello) at his home in northwestern Connecticut, the play chronicles the tail end of a Labor Day weekend for which John's children and grandchildren have gathered.
Still, for the Manhattan Theater Club, coming off a week of highly fraught publicity surrounding Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi,'' the relative toothlessness of Gurney's latest work may be a comfort.
With: Josef Sommer (John), Brooks Ashmanskas (Dennis), Joyce Van Patten (Ellen), Veanne Cox (Ginny) and James Colby (Ralph).
So does ``Labor Day.''
Well, not on the evidence of ``Labor Day.''
In the meantime, the wry but affectionate Ellen is worried that John will humiliate their children by portraying them onstage, even as she expresses the wish that John would be more honest in depicting her relationship with him.
This allows Gurney to joust gently with some of the bugaboos of political correctness explored by Jonathan Reynolds in ``Stonewall Jackson's House.''
