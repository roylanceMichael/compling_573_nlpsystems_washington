Under the Ferry Point deal, the participants _ Nicklaus' Golden Bear International, based in North Palm Beach, Fla.; Gagne Development, of White Plains, N.Y., and the Flag Financial Corp., of New York City _ will spend $22 million to build the course, a driving range, a clubhouse, the marina and restaurant and a catering facility.
NEW YORK _ A bedraggled Bronx garbage heap _ heretofore a place for dumping stolen cars and, at least once, a human body _ will become a $22-million city-owned golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, city officials said Tuesday.
``It's a golf course that will be built on top and not cut in,'' he said.
``There are already plenty of golf courses on public land,'' said David Lutz, program director of the Neighborhood Open Spaces Coalition.
Nicklaus, whose company has designed 152 courses, said he did not want to make the Ferry Point course too complicated.
Nicklaus, citing his experience in building a course on top of a toxic dump site in Montana, said soil would have to be brought in.
But J. Pierre Gagne, a golf-course developer and one of Nicklaus' partners, said that would be a bargain given the quality of the course.
The course, the first new one in the city in 35 years, is planned for an undeveloped section of Ferry Point Park, in the shadow of the Whitestone Bridge.
``People in the neighborhood are longing to see this garbage dump become a nice thing,'' said Dart Westphal, president of the Bronx Council of Environmental Quality, an advocacy group.
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the interest this time around was a result of a booming local and national economy and a ballooning interest in golf _ as well as a new spirit in the city.
