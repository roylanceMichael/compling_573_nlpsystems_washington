AMGEN-DUPONT (Los Angeles) -- DuPont, which has said it wants to purchase a biotech company to increase that division's earnings, loses one possible dance partner when Monsanto Co. agrees to be bought by American Home Products Corp. for $33 billion.
Here are the business news stories the Los Angeles Daily News plans to move for use by NYTimes News Service clients, AMs and PMs of Tuesday, June 2 and thereafter.
That leaves DuPont with last week's rumor du jour: that it would acquire Amgen, the world's largest biotech company.
The stories will carry the ``f'' financial news category code unless otherwise noted.
Daily News columnist Ken Lloyd, Ph.D., a specialist in organizational behavior, answers readers' questions on workplace ethics and relationships.
