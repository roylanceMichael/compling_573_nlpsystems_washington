Romantic love is the ostensible subject, but the novelist also speculates about society, friendship, the uses of power, and what men and women live and love for.
Poems of agony, love, and healing, written for and about Hall's wife, poet Jane Kenyon, who died in 1995.
Seeking to bridge the gap between science and religion, the scientist (and Globe columnist) takes issue with those who misuse both _ and expresses his own awe at the divine creation.
