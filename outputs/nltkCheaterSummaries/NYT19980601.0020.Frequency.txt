Johnson's agent, Barry Meister, said, ``I don't know if the Mariners are making a legitimate offer (to other teams)'' and wouldn't comment further until he had a chance to talk to his client.
Although Johnson has pitched superb back-to-back games since having a meeting with manager Lou Piniella in Texas nearly two weeks ago and being told the best way to get traded is to pitch better, the flurry of recent trade talk hasn't materialized into a deal.
A source close to the Yankees said Sunday that starting pitcher Ramiro Mendoza and minor-league outfielder Ricky Ledee have been offered, but the M's insist on getting Pettitte, off limits despite having a sub-par season (6-5 record).
The Los Angeles Dodgers rejected a proposal that would send right-handed pitcher Darren Dreifort, along with infielder/outfielder Wilton Guerrero to the Mariners, and the New York Yankees refuse to deal left-hander Andy Pettitte.
``We just talked about whether my next start would be in Baltimore (tomorrow) or in Seattle on Wednesday,'' Johnson said.
He struck out 15 Tampa Bay Devil Rays in a complete-game victory on May 24 at the Kingdome and beat the 'Rays again Friday night at Tropicana Field, allowing one earned run and striking out 10 in an eight-inning stint.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Unless the Mariners lower their fair-value-in-return expectations, they apparently will have a hard time granting left-hander Randy Johnson's request to be traded.
With the Dodgers also apparently ready to wait for the price to come down, the trade talk that was roaring last week has quieted and Johnson appears to be getting anxious.
Said Piniella, ``If Randy wants to talk about (the meeting), he can.
Johnson, scheduled to start against the Anaheim Angels Wednesday night at the Kingdome, has been much more demonstrative in his past two starts than any of the previous 10 this season.
