5) seemed models of structural probity in relation to anything that had come before, and Rachmanov made Scriabin's B minor Fantasy seem the Lisztian epic he hinted at in his program notes.
NEW YORK _ By one count, Dmitry Rachmanov, a Russian-born pianist now widely active in the New York area, played three encores on Thursday evening in his recital at Merkin Concert Hall.
Almost inevitable under the circumstances were Liadov's ``Musical Snuffbox'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Flight of the Bumblebee,'' but a Scriabin nocturne for the left hand made for a distinctive close.
His program, ``The Art of the 19th-Century Russian Character Piece,'' offered ditties and little more by 10 composers ranging in fame from Felix Blumenfeld (a ``moment lyrique'') to Tchaikovsky (``Reverie du Soir'' and ``Dumka'').
A few years ago the term ``thematic programming'' seemed to become a value judgment: Any theme was good; any program without one was fatally flawed.
The audience, largely Russian, seemed appreciative, and with good reason, for Rachmanov is in addition a suave and gifted pianist.
And if his program left a listener starved for sustained musical argument, perhaps Rachmanov will supply that next time around.
If he didn't quite master the finger-boggling bravura of Sergei Liapunov's ``Lesginka,'' a ``transcendental etude'' after Liszt, he is surely in good company there.
Character, or characteristic, pieces are pianistic attempts to capture moods, often fleeting, using a dance, a march, a pastoral or nostalgic turn, or the like.
An evening of them, especially in a single national style, palls quickly with repetitive gesture, now gentle, wistful or nostalgic, now dark, bold or brave.
