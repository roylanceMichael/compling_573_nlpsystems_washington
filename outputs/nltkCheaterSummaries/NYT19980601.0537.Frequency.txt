As one of the authors of the ``paycheck protection'' initiative, which would require unions to get permission from each member before spending that member's dues on politics, Bucher has become an enemy of organized labor throughout California.
``No one should be coerced under pressure of losing his job to give money to a cause he doesn't believe in,'' Bucher said, adding that ``labor was 4-1 in favor of us at the start.
Still, Prop 226 would ``wipe unions off the planet,'' said Andrea Adlemanof the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.
Bucher scoffs at labor's stand, saying Prop 226 would in fact give voice to union members who disagree with union leadership.
Supporters, Republican Governor Pete Wilson among them, say unions have no right to spend members' money on political causes that members may not endorse, and that requiring a member's approval each year would restore fairness to the process.
The irony, as Bucher noted, is that unions are both outspending business interests and spending union members' money to defeat a measure intended to give them say in how their union dues are spent.
``The corporations and the people who represent corporations will have total control if this passes,'' said Joe Chacon, a state employee who was working the phones for labor over the weekend.
``The `No' side has hit chords that resonate with voters: that this will steal the voice of working people,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate University.
The ``Vote Yes on 226'' campaign has spent about $3 million making its pitch, he said.
They also worry that the disparity between what business and labor spend on politics would become even greater if union members could easily withhold the political portion of their dues.
