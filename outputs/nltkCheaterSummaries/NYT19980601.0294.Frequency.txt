A Los Angeles Times poll shows that California registered votes, by a margin of more than four to one, believe Checchi has run the most negative campaign, followed by Harman, and then Davis.
``The lesson of California,'' said US Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, who has contemplated a Republican gubernatorial campaign in New York, ``is that you want to make a contribution but you end up spending most of your time trying to get contributions.''
``In a very highly visible race, where there aren't many candidates, it is possible for an underfinanced candidate to win, but in a way it validates the criticism of the role of money,'' said Robert Fellmeth, director of the University of San Diego's Center for Public Interest Law.
``From music to entertainment to the national dress code, almost all trends begin in California _ and politics is no exception,'' said US Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat.
Checchi almost certainly won't win the primary, but he has shaped the character of the race more than Davis, a notion that has not gone un-noticed by political professionals elsewhere.
&LR;  One of the gubernatorial candidates, onetime Northwest Airlines cochairman Al Checchi, may spend $32 million before Tuesday.
``The money people can buy their way into politics,'' said US Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Republican.
&LR;    Checchi was competitive until he started a negative assault, first on Harman, then on Davis.
But the California race also is significant because, in the political as well as popular culture, California is the national pacesetter.
There are only about a dozen political writers who follow state politics, so it is possible to talk to all the insiders of a state of 32 million people within an hour.
