Fundamentalists have been saying for some time that dismal profit growth this year would cause people to pull back from the market: Those in the market would sell some of their holdings to raise cash; those not in it would park their money in cash or bonds until the right moment arrives for stocks.
Yes, fundamentalists will say, people put money in mutual funds, but they did because the economy is growing, inflation is down, yada, yada, yada.
The $26.6 billion investors put into stock funds in April brought total mutual fund assets of all types to more than $5 trillion _ that's trillion with a ``t'' _ for the first time.
Technicians will tell you they look at fundamental factors, and fundamentalists look at lots of technical factors.
Dan Sullivan, who writes one of the better Wall Street market letters, had this astonishing sentence in a recent edition of The Chartist newsletter: ``It's not important to know what business (a) company is in.''
It looks at the relationship between investment markets and such factors as management changes at a company, new products, economic growth rates, inflation and political events.
Fund flow is a technical, not a fundamental, factor and does a good job of explaining the market's rise this year.
Not if billions and billions of dollars continue to flood into stocks from investors buying mutual funds or stashing retirement funds away in 401(k) plans.
What counts is it was the flow of money into the market that pushed stocks higher, not the shrewd, brain-teasing analysis of corporate decisions, GDP growth, Asian flu or anything else.
The idea is political, social and other events influence the way people behave, and one form of behavior is investing in stocks _ or bonds, or real estate or art.
