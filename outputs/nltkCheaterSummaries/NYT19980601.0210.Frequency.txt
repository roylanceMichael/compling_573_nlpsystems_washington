When Suharto stepped down, the people of Indonesia's 13,000-odd islands were generally well off and better educated; they spoke the national language, as well as their own, widely divergent tongues; they no longer groaned under the oppression of the Javanese, the domineering natives of the largest island, and they truly felt themselves citizens of a nation whose motto is ``unity out of diversity.''
Wits used to say that Indonesia was the most stable nation in Asia, perhaps the entire world _ after all, it had had only two presidents in half a century, Sukarno and Suharto.
Certainly no transfer of power in Indonesia's 50 years as a nominal republic had occurred peacefully.
ROME _ The resignation of President Suharto under intense pressure from popular demonstrations and finally from the military, which holds the keys of power, is a great step forward for Indonesia.
Although it was against his will, Suharto's peaceful departure from power nonetheless crowned decades of great accomplishment.
To truly appreciate Suharto it is necessary to have seen the catastrophic effects of Sukarno's government and the extraordinary circumstances under which Suharto came to power in 1966.
Although Suharto was party to the army's vengeful and merciless extermination of several hundred thousand presumed leftists, his normal style was wholly different from Sukarno's.
By the mid-1960s Sukarno's disregard for almost everything except his own glory had produced acute material distress in Indonesia, which had endured several abortive revolts against him, one sponsored by the CIA.
