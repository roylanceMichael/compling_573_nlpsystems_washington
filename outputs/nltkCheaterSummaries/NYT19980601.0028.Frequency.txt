Left to do it all his first few years in the league, Jordan put up wondrous numbers _ like those 63 points against Bird's Celtics _ but the Bulls collectively were no match for the likes of the Celtics or the Detroit Pistons.
He couldn't have done it without his teammates, who provided the support that was too often lacking in the first few years of Jordan's ascension.
In the four seasons leading up to the Bulls' first NBA championship appearance, in 1991, Jordan accounted for nearly one-third of Chicago's scoring.
Jordan had just scored 63 points for the Chicago Bulls in a loss to Bird and the rest of the Boston Celtics.
More than once in the final minutes, Jordan drew double coverage and found his teammates, entrusting them with the ball, yes, but also with all that was riding on the game's outcome.
LOS ANGELES _ It was after an NBA playoff game in 1986 that Larry Bird talked about God being disguised as Michael Jordan.
If Reinsdorf can open the vault for the White Sox's Albert Belle, why not Pippen, who proved his worth again on Sunday by marking Mark Jackson on defense and keeping the Bulls close early while Jordan was struggling to find his rhythm?
Like a latter-day Elijah, Jordan predicted the outcome, then made it happen by going out and collecting 28 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.
Jordan had all but assured a victory on the eve of the game, explaining that the team had a confidence ``we've built over time in pressure situations.''
The first time he checked into the game, the Bulls were trailing by 13 points and looking flatter than a casino chip.
