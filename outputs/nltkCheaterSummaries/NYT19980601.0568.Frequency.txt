But Utah coach Jerry Sloan said he believes his team certainly is better equipped this time around than it was last year when the Jazz was making its first trip to a Finals.
The biggest question going into the series is how Utah's nine days off between games will impact Karl Malone, John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek and Co. All three of the Jazz's key players put the time off to good use, letting some nagging injuries heal.
The question, then, is whether the Jazz can put all of its knowledge to work in the Finals and put the pressure squarely on the Bulls, who have never known the tight feeling that goes along with returning home in a 2-0 hole, which they will do in this series if Utah holds serve in the first leg of the 2-3-2 format.
That's what at least a couple of the NBA's most knowledgeable insiders believe as Jordan and the Chicago Bulls prepare for a rematch against the Utah Jazz in the Finals, which begin Wednesday at the Delta Center.
And with the Jazz capable of playing even tougher defense than the Pacers did, it's logical to see why the Bulls wouldn't be prohibitive favorites in the Finals.
``I will say this: For the first time since Jordan and the Bulls started their championship run, this is the best chance anybody's had (to beat them),'' said Denver general manager Dan Issel.
``I think last year we weren't in awe of them,'' Malone said.
``If the Jazz can't do it, let's say nobody can do it.''
``We don't know if that's going to work in our favor or not,'' Sloan said.
Utah has a chance to end Jordan's season on an unhappy note for just the second time since 1990.
