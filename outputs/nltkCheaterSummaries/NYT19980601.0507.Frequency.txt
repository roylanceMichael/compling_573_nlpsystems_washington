Many telecommunications experts expected the three largest long-distance companies _ AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint _ to invade local phone markets quickly.
Sprint plans to offer the service both in areas where the company already offers local phone service as well as in new regions.
3 long-distance telephone carrier, plans to announce Tuesday its long-awaited strategy for competing in local communications markets, executives close to the company said Monday.
As they await permission from regulators to sell long-distance service within their traditional local telephone regions, Bell Atlantic and SBC each have already signed contracts with Sprint to buy wholesale capacity on Sprint's national fiber optic network.
Bell Atlantic Corp., which offers phone service for much of the area from Virginia to Maine, and SBC Communications Inc. appear to be the Bells that are negotiating most seriously with Sprint, a person close to Sprint said.
The company seems to have spent that time devising some new tactics for use in the continuing battle between long-distance and local phone companies.
Tuesday's announcement comes after Sprint has spent the last two years essentially sitting on the sidelines in terms of competing in new local telephone markets.
A person close to Sprint said the company was hoping to cooperate with the five Bell local telephone companies rather than attack them head-on.
People close to Sprint said the company had spent about $2 billion the last five years developing the new network.
The company plans to begin offering the new service to large business customers later this year and make it generally available to business clients around the middle of next year.
