The NBA Finals open Wednesday night in Salt Lake City and no one who witnessed Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals at the United Center could have not felt that in another time or place, it would have been Larry Bird preparing his team for the Utah Jazz.
The Pacers' next seven possessions resulted in four turnovers, one missed shot, a Miller airball that Antonio Davis redirected, and two Rik Smits free throws.
The Bulls tied the game at 79 on two Jordan free throws and took the lead for good on yet another second-chancer, this one by Pippen.
They did it without Miller, who had only one shot in the fourth quarter (an airball) and no field goals in the final 18 minutes.
But only one will, of course, and that one is the same one that has represented the East six times in the 1990s.
``I can't say the best team won,'' said Scottie Pippen in what, for the Bulls, was a rare moment of humility.
``It wasn't a great game,'' said Chicago coach Phil Jackson.
Smits struggled all night with fouls (he had five) and shooting (3 of 7), and lost a critical jump ball to Jordan in the fourth, tipping it the wrong way.
The Bulls labored through this one, looking a lot like some of those Celtics teams in the 1980s that simply found a way to win when everything appeared to be pointing to a loss.
``It seemed like the little things beat us,'' Bird said.
