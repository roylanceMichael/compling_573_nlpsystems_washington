NEW YORK _ Nine love letters that are to be sold at auction in New York later this month reveal a liaison that took place between Albert Einstein and a married Russian woman in the United States in the closing months of World War II that may have been a good deal more dangerous than the physicist ever realized at the time.
According to ``Special Tasks,'' Konenkova was supposed to ``influence Oppenheimer and other prominent American scientists who she frequently met at Princeton.''
Konenkova's secret side was, according to the New York Times, uncovered first by Paul Needham, a consultant to Sotheby's.
Much more likely to stir fascination in the sale, however, are suggestions that Konenkova was a Russian spy and that introducing Einstein to Soviet diplomats in New York was part of her mission.
Needham stumbled on references to her in a 1995 book written by Soviet spymaster Pavel Sudoplatov and his son Anatoly, called ``Special Tasks.''

Headed by scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer at a secret installation in the New Mexico desert called Los Alamos, the Manhattan Project was the cradle of America's atomic bomb.
Konenkova, the book suggests, had been directed by Moscow to pay special attention to the Manhattan Project.
All the letters were written by Einstein, the father of the theory of relativity, to Margarita Konenkova between 1945 and 1946.
It is known that she succeeded in introducing Einstein to the Soviet consul in New York.
