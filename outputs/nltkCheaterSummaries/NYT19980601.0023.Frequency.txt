When rookie camp begins Monday at Foxboro Stadium, the team's coaching staff and management will be hoping that Robert Edwards, Sedrick Shaw, Harold Shaw, Derrick Cullors, Tony Carter, Chris Floyd, Marrio Grier, and two others can make up for the losses of Curtis Martin, Sam Gash, Keith Byars, and Dave Meggett.
Last summer, Moss reported to camp overweight ... One Jets executive, not Bill Parcells, said the team has no interest in Meggett because it has Leon Johnson, whom Parcells brought along last year.
The experience isn't there, but with Robert Edwards and Sedrick and Derrick, there's ability that just needs time-tested NFL experience for those talents to come out.''
Also in the running back mix is rookie free agent Rodney Byrd, a 6-2, 245-pound halfback/fullback from Illinois (where he played with Robert Holcombe, who was taken in the second round by St. Louis).
After carrying 22 times during the regular season, Cullors ran 29 times for 104 yards in the postseason, including a 22-carries-for-86 yards effort against Miami in the wild-card game.
``We wished we'd given Sedrick a little more playing time during the season last year in retrospect, but we decided to go with Derrick when Curtis went down.
It appears the Patriots believe Edwards and Sedrick Shaw will be able to handle the load as the primary halfbacks and that Carter and Floyd can be the blocking fullbacks they need.
``We'll wait until our camps are over so we can assess what we have and what we feel we need, if anything,'' said vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier.
And Sedrick Shaw carried 10 times for 22 yards in the Pittsburgh game.
They also will check the waiver wire this week for veterans who may be dumped for salary cap reasons _ possibly someone such as Ronnie Harmon, who can add a third-down pass-receiving threat (filling the role of Meggett and Byars).
