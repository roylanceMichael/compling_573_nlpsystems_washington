Successful utility executives inevitably become perceived as ``very important individuals,'' said Keith Bailey, chairman of the Williams Cos., which has transported gas for Western.
``He's been involved in the kind of company _ I don't know if `deified' is the right word _ that tends to push their corporate leadership on to pedestals,'' Bailey said.
The job went to Texan Edward Whitacre Jr.    Zane E. Barnes, Whitacre's predecessor, said of Hayes, ``He is a pretty astute businessman, and he is a very good personality.''
``I am concerned about the same things most Americans are concerned about,'' he said.
``There are so many positive role models in sports,'' he said.
``I worked for him for four years,'' Haines said.
``Things happen where he is,'' Menninger said.
``It was a very little thing,'' Haines said.
``He can Rock Chalk with the best of them,'' Bailey said of Hayes.
``I'll stay involved,'' he said.
