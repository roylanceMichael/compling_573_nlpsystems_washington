NEW YORK _ Telling jurors who are deciding whether her son should be executed that his fate was really ``in the Lord's hands,'' the mother of a former jail guard recounted Monday how she fell apart when the police told her that her ``special child'' killed three people.
``I don't really feel that one incident, as great as it is, should determine his life, should put his life on the line,'' the brother, Esau Harris, said.
Witnesses in the first stage of Harris' trial, which dealt with the question of guilt or innocence, testified that after shooting three men in the head at close range _ two died and one survived _ and finding himself out of bullets, Harris fatally stabbed Evelyn Davis as she beseeched him to spare her life because ``I have five babies to take care of.''
Ms. Harris did not ask the jury to spare her son's life _ the panel may sentence him to death or to life in prison without possibility of parole _ saying instead: ``I don't know what decision you all are making.
But despite the bloody 1996 rampage that made her son, Darrel Harris, the first person to be convicted of first-degree murder under New York state's new capital punishment law, Bertha Harris declared in a Brooklyn courtroom of rapt jurors and spectators, ``My love for my child has not changed.''
``I can only ask, dig deep in your hearts and search out the truth and know that one day shouldn't count for someone's life,'' said Esau Harris, a senior systems engineer for a banking corporation who is also an ordained minister.
``I feel for the mother, she got my heart,'' said a crying Detria Davis, the mother of Evelyn Davis, who was 32 when Harris fatally stabbed her at Club Happiness on the morning of Dec. 7, 1996.
She said her daughter came to her in a vision Monday morning ``and told me she wasn't dead, but I know my daughter is dead,'' Ms. Davis, who is in her 50s, continued.
``He will always have a special place in my heart, regardless of what happens to him,'' she continued, even as she acknowledged his ``very terrible crime.''
One relative of a victim expressed resentment with Harris' relatives because, she said as she left the courthouse, they were making the victims' family members ``feel guilty.''
