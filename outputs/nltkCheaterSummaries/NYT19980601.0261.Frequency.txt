The reverend, as expected, gives incredibly good face _ his immaculately groomed head, which seems bigger than the average head somehow, floats above a stark-white clerical collar.
The headline beneath the head clues us in as to what Rivers is spouting off about this time: ``God Vs. Gangs'' ``What's the Hottest Idea in Crime Fighting?''
It also doesn't hurt the Reverend Rivers to have his painfully earnest mug plastered on the front of the June 1 issue of Newsweek.
That's in tune with the prevailing local criticism of the reverend, which is that he has overcome a lukewarm stature in the black community to present himself as its official spokesman on everything from crime statistics to stupid headlines.
It is, will wonders ever cease, the gall and guts to actually defend a headline renaming Harvard's Henry Louis Gates Jr. ``Head Negro in Charge.''
But there is not one born-again street child quoted, no chronicle of a life turned around.
The power of spirit is new now because Newsweek points to Gene Rivers and Gene Rivers says it is.
And then, the answer, as if the clerical collar wasn't already screaming it: ``The Power of Religion.''
Thrill to his cutting-edge criticism of the black church and, not surprisingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr.!
Already, one Rivers detractor has put the cover to good use.
