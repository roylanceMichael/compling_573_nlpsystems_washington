Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch predicts that Starr will not go that route, although Hatch would like to see Clinton voluntarily testify.
WASHINGTON _ On the question of whether to testify under oath before a grand jury about his relationship with former White House aide Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton cannot win.
``I'd just as soon have this president finish his term,'' Hatch observes wryly, no doubt preferring that the Republicans run for president in 2000 with a diminished Clinton in the White House rather than Al Gore as a freshly anointed president.
That would give Starr the opportunity to call Clinton as a witness in a criminal trial, forcing him to repeat his own denial or invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
If Clinton continues to deny all but Lewinsky cuts a deal and recants her own prior denial under oath, he will be caught up in a humiliating he-says-she-says argument in which she may be the more believable of the two.
Although Clinton has already rebuffed at least four grand jury invitations for his voluntary testimony, Starr is currently stepping up his pressure to get the president on the witness stand.
Editorial and Republican demands that he ``come forward with the truth'' are based on an assumption that he has not yet been honest, his denial is untrue, and that he has committed a criminal act of perjury and obstruction of justice.
If Lewinsky sticks to her denial, she may be indicted for perjury based on whatever evidence to the contrary Starr can produce.
If Clinton has been telling the truth and did nothing wrong, he has a public obligation to put all the suspicions to rest by explaining things.
He has already vowed under oath in his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit and in public statements that he did not have an improper sexual affair with Lewinsky.
