``It'' is Rising Tide, the offshoot of Universal Records that, last fall, released McClinton's exceptional ``One of the Fortunate Few'' CD, easily one of the best in the 57-year-old's storied career.
McClinton has been one of America's best roadhouse rockers for more than a quarter-century, but since 1973's ``Victim of Life's Circumstances'' (on which he wrote every tune) he has let the songwriting go, preferring to fill CDs with cover versions.
In this way, ``One of the Fortunate Few'' is a standout effort: McClinton co-wrote seven of the CD's 10 songs with producer/guitarist Gary Nicholson and others, including Donnie Fritts.
And with it went McClinton's chances of capitalizing, at least for the time being, on his past successes, which include a 1992 Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Duo (with Bonnie Raitt, for ``Good Man, Good Woman'').
But for now, ``One of the Fortunate Few'' is one great CD that isn't getting nearly the attention it deserves.
King, Lyle Lovett, John Prine, Vince Gill, Mavis Staples, Patty Loveless and Lee Roy Parnell, among others, and some of McClinton's finest singing.
Delbert McClinton has been down this road before _ and he's not giving up.
``I was on tour with him two years ago, and I gave him a tape of the song,'' McClinton said.
He's still signed to Universal, and says guardedly that ``we're trying to negotiate a position I can deal with.''
Literally overnight, ``One of the Fortunate Few'' went from a hot blues/rock/country CD to a lame duck.
