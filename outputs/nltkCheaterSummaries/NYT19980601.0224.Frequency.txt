``If you use proper body mechanics _ proper walking techniques and proper posture _ body problems can certainly improve,'' Kahn said.
He, too, is an advocate of proper body alignment and proper walking techniques, especially with patients who've just undergone foot, leg or back surgery and who are learning to walk again.
``Everybody's in pain,'' said the West Los Angeles physical therapist, who has written a book, ``Walk Yourself Well,'' on how to walk properly _ and be pain-free.
Although Brourman's book includes a detailed test to evaluate your walk and diagnose problems, often all she needs to do is watch a person sit, stand and walk to start them on the road to recovery.
If the muscles are strong and the body is in alignment, uncushioned joints won't rub together and hurt, Brourman said.
``The guys usually tell me I'm taking the `cool' out of their walk,'' Brourman said with a laugh.
``You get people to try changing their walk, and they feel the difference and they get this amazed look on their faces,'' she said.
By the time they're 6 months old, toddlers pick up mom's gait, big time.''
But convincing patients that they need to change their walk often brings hesitancy and skepticism, said Brourman.
It doesn't work, she says: ``You can walk with the book on your head and have your body inappropriately balanced.''
