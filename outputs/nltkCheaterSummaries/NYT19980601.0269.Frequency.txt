At many points in the game, the player is asked how to interact with other characters, with a choice of attitudes such as ``funny,'' ``indifferent'' or ``paranoid.''
And because the game is set somewhere between the show's third and fourth seasons, it even includes some long-dead characters, including ``X,'' the undercover operative who before his own untimely assassination sometimes fed information to Mulder, said Letizia.
And because Fox expects the game to attract wide interest, it has included ``artificial intuition,'' sort of the computer equivalent of saying ``warmer, warmer'' when looking for clues.
The massive X-Files game is out there, or at least it will be in a few days, arriving in stores a week or so ahead of the theatrical release of ``The X-Files'' movie and about three weeks after the end of the smash television show's fifth season.
The game includes many delightful touches, including in-joke props that refer to various ``X-Files'' episodes, such as a book of Mulder's by Jose Chung, the goofy character played by Charles Nelson Reilly in a particularly hilarious episode.
``It wouldn't be `The X-Files' without flashlights, so you can adjust that,'' Letizia said.
``The reason we put it in is there are a lot of `X-Files' fans out there who aren't gamers,'' said Letizia.
``How you make those decisions affects how they (the other characters) react,'' Letizia said.
``There are several different endings,'' Letizia said.
``To have a game with seven CDs is just insane,'' said Bill Paris, a video-game writer and columnist for Next Generation and PlayStation magazines.
