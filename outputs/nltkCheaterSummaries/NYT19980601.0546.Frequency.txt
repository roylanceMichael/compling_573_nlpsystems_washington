She edited and wrote the introduction for the book ``Poems of Ambrose Bierce'' (1995, Nebraska), which the literary journal American Notes and Queries, or ANQ, called ``a provocative volume'' that ``should spark further interest in Bierce.''
NEW YORK _ Mary Elizabeth Grenander, a longtime professor of English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce, known for his satirical wit and his horror stories, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne, N.Y. She was 79.
Lisa James of the university's Office of University Relations said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered ``through long-term investments in the stock market.''
Grenander, taught at the State University of New York at Albany from 1948 until she retired in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English.
Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants from institutions including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the New York Council for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Analyzing ironic horror stories he wrote, she once said: ``The actual situation is harmful, with the protagonist conceiving it to be harmless and reacting accordingly.''
She gave more than $1 million to SUNY Albany, including $500,000 to establish a professorship in memory of her husband, James Corbett, a professor of physics at the same university, who died in 1994.
She was born in Rewey, Wis., and received bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate, all in English, from the University of Chicago, in the 1940s.
Her many writings about Bierce, who was born in 1842 and went to Mexico in 1913 and vanished, appeared over more than two decades.
She was a former president of the New York American Studies Association.
