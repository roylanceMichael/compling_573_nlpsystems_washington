Foyt says the engine in Billy Boat's Indianapolis 500 pole-winning car was ``sabotaged'' the night before the big race while locked inside his garage at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
``Somebody did some sabotage on Billy Boat's car,'' Foyt said during a teleconference previewing the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's True Value 500K night race at Texas Motor Speedway on June 6.
Ironically, Boat originally was declared the winner of last year's True Value 500K at TMS.
Foyt Racing and his nephew, and Craig Baranouski, Boat's chief mechanic, were the first crewmen to arrive at the garage Sunday.
``I don't think there's suspicion among the team,'' said Boat, who led the race's first 12 laps but finished 23rd because of a faulty gearbox.
``Somebody dropped red Loctite on the last two (fuel injector) butterflies on the left engine bank.
Foyt said the engine had been run at 2 p.m. Saturday, after which the garage was locked and ``sealed'' at approximately 2:30.
``The butterfly controls how much air gets into the engine,'' Boat said from his business, B&AMP;B Fabrication in Phoenix.
It run down the throttle shaft and locked the two butterflies solid.''
``We knew somebody had went through,'' said Foyt, first four-time winner of the Indy 500.
