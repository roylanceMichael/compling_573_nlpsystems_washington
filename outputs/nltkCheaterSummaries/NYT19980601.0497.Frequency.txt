&QL;    Dorian Boose, the Jets' top draft pick, was a close friend and Washington State teammate of Eric Bender, the Raiders' second-round draft pick who was found dead Saturday at a business associate's home in Marietta, Ga. Boose and Bender were roommates, both played defensive line and both often talked of making it in the NFL.
``I've got a bit of a logjam at right tackle,'' Parcells said Monday as the week of rookie camp began.
Williams was one of four highly touted free agents the Jets picked up for $57 million in long-term contracts in 1996: he joined quarterback Neil O'Donnell, left tackle Jumbo Elliott and wide receiver Jeff Graham.
The Jets turned themselves around anyway, improving to 9-7 last year in Bill Parcells' first season as the coach, but with less help from Williams.
With Williams gone, Jason Fabini, a fourth-round draft pick from Cincinnati, a school that rarely produces offensive linemen for the pros, now becomes a candidate at right tackle.
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets lost another key component of the high-profile influx of offense they made two years ago when they released right tackle David Williams on Monday.
The Jets will not be looking at David Meggett, Parcells said, despite the fact that Meggett was one of his favorite players.
Graham was traded last draft day, while O'Donnell remains unwavering in his demand that he receive his full 1998 salary of $4.2 million.
Parcells wants a player like Fabini to make it for two obvious reasons: He could have a long run with the team, and he is cheaper to sign.
In addition to Fabini, there is the veteran Siupeli Malamala, who was once the club's starter at the position, as well as the rookie Eric Bateman of Brigham Young and Deron Thorp of Nevada, who spent last season playing for the Barcelona Dragons of the NFL Europe.
