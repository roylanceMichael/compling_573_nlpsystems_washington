NEW YORK _ Since the days when Carmen Miranda wore fruit on her head, consumers have been urged to wear Fruit of the Loom apparel on their bodies.
The new campaign represents a gamble for Fruit of the Loom because the company does not want to alienate traditional, value-minded buyers as it tries to attract younger, less conventional consumers with offerings like men's boxers and boxer briefs and women's thongs and bikini briefs.
The campaign places emphasis on what executives at Fruit of the Loom and Warwick Baker refer to as the brand's ``fruitness,'' which O'Neill described as an ``essential playfulness and friskiness, capturing the fit and fashion.''
``The answer was in the brand itself,'' said William Mulligan Jr., client services director at Warwick Baker, because consumers who were asked to talk about Fruit of the Loom in research sessions used words like ``approachable, sexy, wholesome, friendly, relevant.''
``This advertising is the public expression of efforts going on at Fruit of the Loom to modernize their offerings,'' said Kevin O'Neill, president and chief creative officer at Warwick Baker, who offered a preview of the campaign.
And print ads for women's apparel carry such headlines as ``Instead of Serving Fruit, Why Not Let Fruit Serve You?''
Was any thought given to reviving the ``Fruit Guys,'' the actors who once brought to life the fruit in the brand's emblem?
``In keeping with the broad appeal of the brand,'' said John Wendler, senior vice president for marketing at Fruit of the Loom in Bowling Green, Ky., the models are intended to be ``all-American, regular guys who want to wear fashionable products,'' rather than ``chiseled, edgy, European-looking.''
For instance, the waistbands of some kinds of boxer briefs are emblazoned with the initials ``FTL'' in place of ``Fruit of the Loom'' or the familiar fruit emblem.
Fruit of the Loom previously tried to modify attitudes about its products with a humorous campaign by offices of the Leo Burnett Co., which was centered on clotheslines displaying colorful apparel.
