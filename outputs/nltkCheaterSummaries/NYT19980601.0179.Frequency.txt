``Better horses (than Real Quiet) might have gotten beat in the Triple Crown,'' Walden acknowledged, ``but it takes a special horse to be able to win all three.
Victory Gallop is scheduled to try again in the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes, but ``50-50'' Grand Slam would be the race's only Grade 1 winner other than Real Quiet.
``He possibly might not have the charisma or mystique that some of the other Triple Crown winners have had,'' said Elliott Walden, who trains Kentucky Derby and Preakness runner-up Victory Gallop.
Lukas, who will run Yarrow Brae and possibly Grand Slam in the upcoming Belmont, used last year's Triple Crown races as an illustration of the pitfalls of judging the quality of developing young horses.
When Silver Charm won the Derby and the Preakness, he was being widely hailed as a deserving Triple Crown winner until he lost the Belmont to Touch Gold.
But if Real Quiet wins the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, opposing trainers say he will deserve to be ranked alongside those famed 1970s horses as a deserving Triple Crown champion.
But if he doesn't win the Belmont, he is simply another good horse who couldn't quite stand up to the rigors of an intense five-week schedule that thwarted recent would-be sweepers such as Alysheba, Sunday Silence and Silver Charm.
Although Lukas has never trained a Triple Crown winner, his horses have won three Derbies, four Preaknesses and three Belmonts.
``Most people thought (Silver Charm) was a hell of a horse and still do,'' Lukas said.
He said Real Quiet is deserving of accolades if he proves talented and durable enough to win all three races.
