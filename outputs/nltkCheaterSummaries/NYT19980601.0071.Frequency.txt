Throwing myself against the little window in the door so he couldn't look in, I yelled, ``What do you want?''
``Quick, run to the craft store and get three more sheets of the blue cloud paper, two with a sports theme, one more of the music and the super-size glue stick.
Blithely, I went off to the craft store, selected a big, red book, an array of colorful acid-free papers, stickers and glue sticks.
Handing me the sack, he said, ``I got lost in the potpourri department and couldn't get out.
And those I hold in my heart don't need any acid-free guarantee to preserve them.
At first, the Memory Book seemed like a good idea.
