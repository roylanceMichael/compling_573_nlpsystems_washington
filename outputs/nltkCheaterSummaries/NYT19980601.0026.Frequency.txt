``It's a lot different than New York, the people who come to the game, there's a lot less pressure on a player here,'' Lalas said.
As do Lalas's numerous fans here, particularly those in the end zone, one of whom continues to wear a red wig of about the same length as Lalas's former hairstyle.
_ MetroStars defender Alexi Lalas claimed that Sunday's game against the Revolution, his former team, was no different than most.
In fact, Lalas said hello to Rongen, and the Revolution coach said hello back.
``When you're my size'' _ 6 feet 3 inches _ ``waiting a second compared to waiting a second for someone Johnny Torres's size'' _ Torres is 5-6 _ ``is two totally different things.''
``Thomas and I still talk and I value him as a friend and as someone that gives good advice,'' Lalas said after his team's shootout win over the Revolution following a 1-1 regulation tie.
Lalas was his team's seventh shooter in the shootout, the teams tied at 2 at the time, but his bid was knocked down by Revolution goalkeeper Jeff Causey.
``He's just a punk,'' said Lalas of Mohammed.
Lalas wasn't trying to gain revenge on the Revolution for trading him or trying to look good for the US national team, for which he'll probably be a reserve in the World Cup.
``I had two great years here and the fans came to the stadium and were great to me,'' said Lalas.
