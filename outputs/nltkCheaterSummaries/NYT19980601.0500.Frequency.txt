Russell Ahr, an INS spokesman, said he could not comment specifically on Wroclawski's case, but said Judge Dean LeVay, should he agree to open the case, would be fair and impartial toward the wrestler.
``He's helped the American wrestling scene and our (the government's) thinking is to turn around in a cold-hearted approach and throw him out of the country without his day i n court.''
Unless a U.S immigration judge agrees to hear Wroclawski's case, he and his family will be shipped out of the country on June 15 to Poland, where he is accused of treason and political enemies await.
``It's very cold and there was no effort to try to show some compassion,'' Whitehead said.
Wroclawski's first hearing, in mid-1997, was suspended w hen the judge and INS officials said they wanted to read the book.
``No explanation was given,'' said Marshall Whitehead, a Phoenix lawyer representing Wroclawski, a 1982 world Greco-Roman champion who trains wrestlers in the Valley.
Should LeVay decide to rehear the case, a decision expected later this week, Wroclawski's family would be allowed to stay in the country.
``If he leaves the country, we'd have a very difficult time appealing these things,'' Whitehead said.
``It was a really emotional meeting and especially emotional for my kids,'' Wroclawski said through an interpreter.
``The outcome is not guaranteed,'' Ahr said.
