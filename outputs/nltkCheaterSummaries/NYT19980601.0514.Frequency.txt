Netgear's product line, however, recently won an ``Editor's Choice'' award from PC Magazine for ``the best combination of extensive offerings, low pricing, ease of use, and excellent technical support.''
If your network grows beyond 15 or 20 computers (even fewer, if you get powerful network accounting packages or other heavy-duty applications), you may need to consider a more complex ``client-server'' network with a powerful network operating system such as Windows NT or Novell's Netware.
Before you rush out and hire a consultant, however, learn the basics from one of several excellent primers, such as ``Networking for Dummies'' by Doug Lowe (IDG Books) or ``Absolute Beginner's Guide to Networking'' by Mark Gibbs and Todd Brown (Sams).
For shared Internet use, add a ``router,'' a device which connects the network hub with the Internet connection, such as a regular phone line or higher speed, digital ISDN line.
Buy so-called ``10/100'' cards, capable of operating at 100 megabits per second as well as the usual network speed of 10 Mbps, just in case you ever need the extra performance.
It needs a central box called a ``hub'' to which the computers all connect.
An efficient network also centralizes files on one computer, called a ``server,'' a sort of file lending library.
ISDN routers, which let users share the same ISDN line for Internet access, now cost under $500 and often come with a small hub built in.
If your employees are power users, sending big graphics files over the network, consider buying a faster hub, called a 100Base-T hub.
