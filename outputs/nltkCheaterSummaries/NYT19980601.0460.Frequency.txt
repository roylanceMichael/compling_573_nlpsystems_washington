Walter Umphrey of Beaumont, one of the lawyers hired by Morales when the tobacco lawsuit was filed in 1996, attended one meeting in which money for Morales was discussed, the court document said.
Morales spokesman Ward Tisdale said the attorney general opposes the effort to question Jamail because the legislators aren't parties to the tobacco lawsuit.
AUSTIN, Texas _ If Houston attorney Joe Jamail has information that Attorney General Dan Morales improperly solicited millions of dollars in the tobacco case, he should be allowed to tell his story under oath, a spokeswoman for Gov.
According to a document the legislators filed in federal court last week, Morales solicited $1 million from each of several lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco lawsuit.
The money was ``purportedly for the purpose of defending General Morales against possible attacks from the tobacco companies,'' the document said.
In separate court challenges, the governor and the seven lawmakers are trying to block $2.3 billion in legal fees awarded to five other private attorneys who helped Morales obtain the $15.3 billion tobacco settlement.
The only expense reports Morales said he received from the outside lawyers totaled $1.7 million for 1996, the year the lawsuit was filed.
Hughes, the governor's spokeswoman, has said there was never a serious offer to mediate and no guarantee that part of the fees wouldn't come out of the state's share of the settlement.
Neither Morales nor the outside lawyers have publicly accounted for how most of the $40 million was spent, despite a formal demand submitted by Bush to the attorney general's office three months ago.
Karen Hughes, the governor's communications director, said Bush isn't involved in the effort to question Jamail.
