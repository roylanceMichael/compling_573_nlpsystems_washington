Hindus wrote ``Charles Reznikoff: Man and Poet'' (1984), and ``Charles Reznikoff: A Critical Essay'' (1977), and was working on ``The Collected Letters of Charles Reznikoff'' this year.
A native New Yorker, Hindus was teaching at the University of Chicago when he was recruited as one of Brandeis' 13 original faculty members when the university opened in 1948.
Professor Milton Hindus, a scholar of American and European literature and the last of Brandeis University's original faculty, died on Thursday when he collapsed outside the main entrance to the campus in Waltham, Mass.
Hindus is survived by his wife of 55 years, Eva Tenenbaum Hindus, and a daughter, Myra Hindus, of Jamaica Plain, Mass.
Before joining the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1946, he did postgraduate work at Columbia University and lectured at Hunter College and the New School for Social Research in New York.
He devoted much of his time in recent years to the work of Charles Reznikoff, a Brooklyn-born poet and editor (1894-1976).
Hindus suffered a heart attack after leaving Goldfarb Library, where he had continued to work since retiring from teaching in 1981, Brandeis reported.
He wrote ``Celine: The Crippled Giant'' (1950), a critical biography of the French writer Louis Ferdinand Celine, which was reissued as a paperback in 1997.
He also edited ``Walt Whitman'' for the Critical Heritage Series (1997).
He was the author of ``Leaves of Grass: One Hundred Years Later'' (1955), which remains in print and earned him the Walt Whitman Prize of the Poetry Society of America.
