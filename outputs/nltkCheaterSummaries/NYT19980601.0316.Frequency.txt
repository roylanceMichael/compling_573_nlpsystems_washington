If you're new to exercising _ less than three weeks _ it's better to err on the side of caution and sit out exercising while sick, advises Greg Bennett, a senior exercise physiologist at the Health and Lifestyle Center of Memorial Hospital in South Bend, Ind.
If it's simply a cold that's cut your energy levels and given you a runny nose, you might want to work out, but at reduced levels.
A sports physiologist and a personal trainer we consulted on this question say there is no definitive answer to your question but there simple guidelines to follow when sniffles catch up with you.

First, decide if the symptoms are more cold-like or flu-like, says Ken Baldwin, a personal trainer and president of Premier Fitness Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
Don't try to catch up, or overdo your exercising to make up for the days missed, cautions Bennett.
Baldwin and Bennett say that exercising too soon after you've been sick, or overdoing exercise, can sap the immune system.
``We usually advise people to go home, rest, and drink a lot of fluids,'' says Baldwin, an official of IDEA, an international association that educates those in the exercise industry.
If symptoms are flu-like, says Baldwin, and you have chest congestion or fever, you might want to stay off the treadmill.
You won't lose those strength or cardiovascular gains in just a few days, he adds.
