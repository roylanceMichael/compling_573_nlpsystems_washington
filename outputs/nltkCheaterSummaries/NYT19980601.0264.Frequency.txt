But Colebrook's children, Venne says, learned that day that people _ even big, important, strong people like police officers _ can die.
``It is New Hampshire's tragedy of the decade,'' says New Hampshire Attorney General Philip McLaughlin, ``maybe tragedy of the century.''
&UR;    &LR;  Drega killed New Hampshire state troopers Les Lord and Scott Phillips first, as they sought to question him about the dilapidated state of his pickup and threats he'd made against District Judge Vickie Bunnell.
``We'll have good days, and then there's days you just don't want to get out of bed,'' says Colebrook Police Chief Mike Sielicki.
``I think most of the town feels it's time to put this to rest,'' says Sylvia Collins, who manages the state liquor store here.
&UR;  &LR; COLEBROOK, N.H. _ Last Aug. 19, a hole was ripped in this town's heart.
In New Hampshire, Colebrook is the tragedy by which people measure time.
Chuck West, a New Hampshire state trooper who was involved in the shootout in which Drega was killed, says the murders ``rocked us right to the foundation.''
``There was a real setting of the jaw here, almost before the shots had died away, that this monster and this horror were not going to change this place,'' says John Harrigan, publisher of the weekly News &AMP; Sentinel, where Joos worked and where Bunnell had her office.
Sielicki says he's not sure how much of that is a direct correlation to Drega, but that they've never had so many problems in the schools.
