Incontinence comes in two main forms _ urge problems like Duffy's, in which bladder muscles go into spasm, making it impossible to stop urine flow once it starts; and stress problems, in which weak sphincter or pelvic muscles fail to keep the bladder neck closed during sudden physical stresses like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising.
For urge incontinence specifically, other drugs also help _ including old standbys like Ditropan and newer ones like Levbid and Detrol, says Dr. David Staskin, director of the continence center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
``For every kind of incontinence, there's a pill, or behavioral intervention, a device or an operation,'' says Dr. Neil Resnick, an incontinence specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
Two weeks ago, Duffy and two other women became the first patients in New England to have a new electrical device called InterStim implanted near their spines to calm bladder spasms.
But surgery to implant the InterStim ``pacemaker'' like Duffy should become a growing option.
If you can't pinpoint those muscles on your own, go to a continence center (many hospitals have them) and ask for biofeedback training, a system of electrical sensors on patches on the skin or in the vagina or rectum that send an unmistakeable signal when you contract the right muscles.
Soon, women may also have another option _ a foam patch called Impress that's designed to stick to the urethral opening like a tiny BandAid.
Some women, for instance, use vaginal cones, tampon-like devices held in the vagina for 15 minutes twice a day to strengthen pelvic muscles.
Over the years, Kathy Duffy, a 38-year-old school teacher, tried many treatments for her severe incontinence _ pills, injections, exercises, even ``retraining'' her bladder.
Applying an electric current to the bladder nerves seems to shut down the C-fibers but not normal fibers, says Swierzewski, who implanted the device in Duffy and two other patients.
