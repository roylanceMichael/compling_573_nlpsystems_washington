Although Galveston County was only a half-inch off on its normal annual rainfall as the new month began, Monday marked the 76th day with no rain on about 30,000 acres of land on which milo, corn and soybeans normally would have been growing this time of year, farmer and rancher J.B. Evans told commissioners court.
GALVESTON, Texas _ With no crops in the ground and scant prospect of significant rain, farmers in Galveston and other southeast Texas counties are expecting major losses this year.
To help soften the blow, farmers are asking county commissioners courts to start the paperwork for declaration of their counties by state and federal officials as drought-stricken areas qualified for insurance payments, low-cost loans and other possible aid.
March's 1.92 inches marked the last rain in Galveston County, Evans said.
Galveston County Judge Jim Yarbrough agreed Monday to forward a request for disaster declaration to state officials as soon as he gets the necessary paperwork in hand.
Insurers ``don't recognize drought as a cause for claims on insurance unless it's documented through the county,'' Evans said.
Doris Campbell, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency in Galveston and Brazoria counties, plans to ask Brazoria County Judge John Willey to do the same.
Early rains kept farmers from preparing fields for planting and lack of rain since late March left fields without the moisture needed for planting seed, Evans said.
``It's affected a lot of people, even the rice farmers,'' said Evans, who said his losses could hit $150,000.
``The problem is not how much rain we had, but when it fell,'' Evans said after addressing commissioners.
