A test of several phones at the station found that voice-mail messages could be retrieved but that punching in too many voice-mail commands _ what the breaking point is is not clear _ produced the message ``No additional dialing allowed'' and caused the keypad to go dead.
&QL;    Now that phone fraud has abated, the Port Authority has decided on a six-month experiment at the bus terminal: Since January about a dozen phones without distinguishing markings have allowed access to voice-mail and to outgoing international calls.
But if you dial a company's 800 number, you will not be able to gain access to such voice-mail functions as retrieving messages, according to Ken Philmus, former manager of the midtown terminal and now deputy general manager at Kennedy International Airport.
As the tiny type on notices affixed to almost all of the phones at the bus depot says: ``This phone does not permit access to: paging or V-mail systems; incoming calls; international calls.''
&QL;    At Grand Central Terminal, no international outgoing calls can be made and access to voice-mail may also be limited, Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North, said.
Since the museums and the City Hall don't open till 10 a.m., you could stop at a cafe on the Grand'Place or observe the flower market there; it runs till 11 or 11:30.
&UR; Layover in Brussels &LR;    Q. I will have a layover at the Brussels airport from 7:45 a.m. until 2:55 p.m. Can you recommend how to use this time to see some of Brussels?
The airport, Zaventem, could hardly be handier to the city: The train from Zaventem runs every 20 minutes during the day, and it's just a 18-minute ride to the Gare Centrale.
For some reason, the Port Authority has disabled its phones so that phone cards and such devices as voice-mail can't be used.
Stolen card numbers were obtained by shoulder surfing _ eavesdropping or watching someone make a legitimate call and then using that caller's card number.
