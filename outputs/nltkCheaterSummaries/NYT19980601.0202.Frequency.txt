And now, in this week's science journal ``Nature,'' a team from the University of Exeter announce that it has finally worked out how plants produce vitamin C _ opening the way, it says, to genetically-engineered versions of the fruit which produce far greater amounts of such useful vitamins.
``First, engineer viruses that normally attack plants so they put proteins from disease-causing organisms on their surface, so that the plants produce a vaccine to them.
If you can work out which gene makes the required protein, then you are just one step away from your target; all you need to do is find a way for your required plant to make it, by adding the gene to the plant in such a way that it is ``expressed'' in the fruit, skin or other useful part.
Similarly, the Exeter team's unravelling of the ``chemical pathway'' by which plants make vitamin C is a key advance which ends a 40-year search.
That has potential benefits in both nutrition and for the ability of plants to withstand various kinds of environmental stresses that would normally reduce crop yield,'' said Nicholas Smirnoff, a lecturer in plant biochemistry who led the research at Exeter.
``In the long run it means, if people so wish, that we can genetically engineer plants to have altered vitamin C content.
``The big companies aren't involved yet, because I think they have been cynical about doing things with plants,'' said Dr. Cubitt.
But while gene-jeans may excite casual interest, the real focus is on altering plants so that they will become truly useful ``factories'' for chemicals such as vaccines; or simply making them more fertile, so that the same land area can feed the ever-expanding number of mouths in the world.
Similar efforts are being made with standard crops: already, just 15 crop plants provide 90 percent of the world's food energy.
Among them is Cambridge-based Axis Genetics, which is working on a number of schemes to coax vaccines out of transgenic plants.
