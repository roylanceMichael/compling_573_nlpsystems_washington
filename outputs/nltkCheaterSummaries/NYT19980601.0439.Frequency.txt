The team said the magnetars have the most intense magnetic fields observed in the universe, fields one thousand trillion times the Earth's magnetic field.
The site's goal is to track these thumb-sized birds of yellow, blue, red, green, black and white, who sing with a range of rich warbles or trills or rings, and to improve the data on the routes of the warblers, whose annual commute from South and Central America homeward to Canada and the United States typically covers thousands of miles.
Once Upon a Magnetar    Traces of a dark relic of a once-bright star 40,000 light-years from Earth have confirmed the existence of a class of neutron stars called magnetars, according to a team of scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
Using satellite data, her team measured the fields by assessing how the speed of rotation of the star is slowing, which is linked to the power of the magnetic field.
The discovery of magnetars points to vast new frontiers in space, said Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou, a gamma-ray astronomer at the center who directed the team.
Now the Research Service of the federal Department of Agriculture is exploring a factory-style solution to the problem: a 77,000-square-foot composting center that can handle 100 tons of cow and poultry manure and used livestock bedding a day.
At the Web site, you can learn which states have the most sightings (New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida), or the greatest variety by species (Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Louisiana).
One area of emphasis has been finding rapid techniques for bulk composting of organic byproducts, in which the heat produced _ temperatures in a heap can top 130 degrees _ kills all disease organisms.
A magnetar has a magnetic field that is 100 times stronger than the typical neutron star.
If you aren't sure _ and most people aren't, even while looking at a bird book _ a new Web site will play the song for you.
