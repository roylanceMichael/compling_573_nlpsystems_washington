It had nothing to do with a typical rainfall closure,'' said Martin Strain, owner of the Point Reyes Oyster Co.    Ben Werner, chief of the disease investigations section at the state Department of Health Services, said the reported illness could be caused either by a virus or bacteria.
``We haven't had a California oyster in more than two weeks,'' said Steve Sancimino of San Francisco's venerable Swan Oyster Depot.
More than three weeks after the first case was reported, state health officials still don't know, and until they do, the harvesting of Tomales Bay oysters, which have graced the menus of the West's finest restaurants, is suspended indefinitely.
We have to figure out ways of making it work, and I haven't figured it out yet,'' said Drew Alden, owner of Tomales Bay Oysters, which has been in business since 1909.
MARSHALL, Calif. _ Tomales Bay oyster farmers who have earned a national reputation for their sweet morsels say that an outbreak of illness traced to oysters from their beds imperils their market niche and perhaps even their survival.
Some kind of contaminant got into the beds of the Hog Island, Point Reyes and Tomales Bay companies in early May and was passed onto diners who ate raw or undercooked oysters.
``This is when we get rockin' and rollin', when people start coming to West Marin and barbecuing oysters,'' said Alden.
``We've got to carry on,'' said Hog Island co-owner Mike Watchorn, grimacing as he unloaded bags of oysters trucked in fresh overnight from Washington.
``This is very frustrating,'' agreed Terry Sawyer, a co-owner of Hog Island Oyster Co.
Local markets and restaurants that relied on Tomales Bay oyster farmers are turning to other sources.
