``They said we couldn't reshape the attorney general's office to focus on crime without walking away from the traditional consumer and environmental responsibilities of this office,'' Vacco told about 100 supporters and employees.
ALBANY, N.Y. _ Saying he has reduced crime, protected the environment and fought consumer fraud more voraciously than his predecessors, Dennis Vacco announced Monday that he would seek a second term as New York state's attorney general.
They are Eliot Spitzer, a former state prosecutor; G. Oliver Koppell, a former attorney general, and state Sen. Catherine Abate.
In his speech Monday, Vacco, who campaigned in 1994 on a crime-fighting platform, focused on many of the issues that his critics say he neglected during his first two years in office: those involving consumer protection and the environment.
He eked out a victory over the Democratic candidate, Karen Burstein, largely because of the backing of U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the state's most influential Republican.
He described a crackdown by his office on health-care aides who abuse nursing home residents and a new division in his office that mediates disputes between managed-care companies and their patients.
George Pataki and other powerful Republicans, Vacco said he was the first attorney general in decades to devote equal attention to fighting crime and protecting consumers.
Several months after he was elected, he came under heavy criticism for dismissing dozens of experienced lawyers and replacing them with younger, inexperienced lawyers, many of whose families had ties to the Republican Party.
The attorney general's race is expected to be one of the most hotly contested this year, because Vacco is widely believed to be politically vulnerable.
Vacco, 45, a former U.S. attorney in Buffalo, was little known before he ran for attorney general in 1994.
