``Brandt (Wynalda's older brother) made his purchase and left the store, but Eric was kind of hanging back,'' Dave Wynalda said.
``He's an enigma,'' said Brian Quinn, coach of Wynalda's MLS team, the Clash.
``Brandt went to see what was going on and Eric whispered in his ear and Brandt made his purchase because Eric was too shy.''
``That's what gives people the wrong impression,'' Wynalda said.
``He would just stand there with his hands on hips and just kick things,'' Sue Wynalda said.
When the U.S. men's national soccer team opens World Cup '98 June 15 against Germany in Paris, Wynalda will be on stage again.
Since that incident, Wynalda has grown from upstart forward for a fledgling U.S. team to veteran goal scorer _ 32 international goals in all _ for a team that hopes to break into soccer's elite by advancing to the second round of the Cup.
``People compare him to Barkley or (Dennis) Rodman, but how many kids can go and touch Barkley after a game?''
Wynalda's growth is borne out by his tempered persona on the field, his decision to forgo a second chance to play soccer in Germany so he could be in the United States to focus on the World Cup, and his desire to give back to the game.
``But I think it's one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me because it taught me so much about myself.
