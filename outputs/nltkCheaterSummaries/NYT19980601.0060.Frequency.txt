That's because I failed to be in Milwaukee recently for the International Space Development conference at which former astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin spoke about space tourism.
It's the only way, he said, to create ``a great consensus of people'' behind the nation's space program.
&QL;    Mark this down: Space tourism is an idea whose time will come, and Buzz Aldrin's promotion of the idea will be seen one day as the turning point.
``If they want to go to the moon or Mars, they better get behind (space) tourism.''
&QL;    It turns out, by the way, that spending campaign time entertaining people in Milwaukee kitchens with hilarious baseball stories is no way to get to the White House.
&QL;    Aldrin's answer the the space problem is to create a lottery system that would pick who gets to go.
&QL;    We were in the kitchen of someone's Milwaukee house for a fund-raiser, and McCarthy was regaling the crowd with spectacularly funny baseball stories from back when he played in the Sioux League or some such in Minnesota or wherever.
&QL;    ``That's my message to the astronauts,'' Aldrin said.
&QL;    You may wonder why I was imagining my own answering machine message if the idea is to find the most annoying people.
Rather, I'd have others write essays telling why they wanted to get rid of someone by sending him or her into space.
