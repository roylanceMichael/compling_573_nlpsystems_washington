But Meola aggressively dove at Michallik's feet in the 12th minute, then blocked Baba's point-blank volley and Dahir Mohammed's rebound in the 35th minute.
``In the last few games we haven't been able to take the lead and we have ended up scoring in a desperate fashion,'' Rongen said.
Mohammed blocked a Paul Dougherty header on the line, then McKinley made a diving clearance of a Kelly shot in the 44th minute of a 50-minute half.
Eduardo Hurtado touched Rooney's pass from just over the halfway line on the left side, and Kelly ran onto it and poked a shot past Ian Feuer with the outside of his right foot.
Last year, the Revolution's Alberto Naveda scored a hat trick in a 3-1 victory over the MetroStars to give them 13 goals in 11 games.
The Revolution scored a late goal to tie the score, 1-1, against the New York-New Jersey MetroStars Sunday, but lost in the shootout to remain in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 10 points in 11 games.
In the shootout, Tony Meola saved Richard Goulooze's final attempt as the MetroStars improved to 16 points, 5 ahead of fourth-place Miami.
This was McKinley's second ejection and he will be suspended from the Revolution's visit to Los Angeles June 7.
They again fell behind, as Brian Kelly finished a quick strike started in the MetroStars' half by Jim Rooney in the 69th minute.
But after Ivan McKinley was ejected for a deliberate handball to prevent a goal, Gorter moved into a sweeper position as the Revolution played with 10 men.
