``But don't convert unless you have to,'' Salem said, ``because it's not worth it and because they're sitting on a huge stockpile of R-12.
``Our strongest recommendation is if it's an R-12 car, continue to use R-12,'' said Atkinson, who worked with the federal government in drawing up rules for banning R-12 production.
``I have access to R-12 for at least the next four years,'' Salem said, noting that Freon use by his shop has been tapering off since 1995.
``The price is down and supplies are plentiful,'' said Ward Atkinson, a Scottsdale air-conditioning specialist.
``If you do have car furnished with one of these types refrigerants, basically your car is married to that shop,'' she said.
Just a few years ago, the outlook seemed grim: production of the refrigerant R-12, known as Freon, would ce ase in 1995, forcing motorists everywhere to endure an expensive conversion of their automobile air-conditioners to use a new generation of refrigerant.
``All those things have r esulted in an adequate supply,'' Atkinson said.
Atkinson said automakers and dealers stockpiled R-12 because of fear s that the supply would dry up before they could service cars and trucks under warranty.
Production of Freon is banned, all right, but instead of supplies evaporating, the refrigerant is readily available and should stay t hat way for years to come.
He said the only time an yone should convert to the newer refrigerant is if the AC system needs a big repair, such as a compressor failure.
