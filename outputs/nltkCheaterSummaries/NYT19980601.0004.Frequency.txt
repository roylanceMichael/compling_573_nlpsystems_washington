``Right now, I'm not sure if he can beat Silver Charm,'' McAnally said of Mud Route, ``but at least he's won a stake.''
Until he surged to the lead on the turn for home at Hollywood Park and held off Deputy Commander by two lengths, he was the best horse who'd never won a stakes race.
Deputy Commander, trying to find his Travers- and Super Derby-winning form and carrying six pounds more than the field, came wide and finished 2{ lengths in front of third-place Worldly Ways.
Mud Route, ridden and trained by Hall of Famers Chris McCarron and Ron McAnally, was an early West Coast favorite for the 1997 Kentucky Derby after swift maiden and allowance victories _ but shin problems sidelined him until fall.
A confidence-building victory against cheaper horses last time out set him up for The Californian, a $250,000 race whose 45 winners include 10 national champions.
Next is the June 28 Hollywood Gold Cup, where the question will be if he can beat Gentlemen and Skip Away, and the popular answer will be ``no.''
Also expected for that $1 million race are Malek, Puerto Madero, Behrens, Bagshot and Deputy Commander.
Later Sunday, McCarron and McAnally teamed up again to win the $150,000 Estrapade Stakes on the turf with late-running Proud Fillie ($5.40).
No Californian winner has captured the Gold Cup since Cutlass Reality 10 years ago.
At Santa Anita this winter, the colt twice finished second to '97 Derby winner Silver Charm.
