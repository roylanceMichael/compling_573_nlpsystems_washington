I would counter it with a ``summer breakfast'' which is never served before 10 a.m.    ``Power napping'' is supposed to show that you are recharging for the next task.
The opposite of ``summer'' is ``power.''
People put the word ``power'' in front of perfectly harmless nouns to suggest an activity more purposeful, self-improving and dynamic than you would otherwise suspect.
For example, a ``power breakfast'' puts a whole new spin on a bowl of cereal.
``Power walking'' is fast-paced, timed and on a set course.
``Summer napping'' is best done in a place where nobody can find you for the next task.
We use ``summer'' as a modifier because it conjures brighter, happier, more irresponsible images than any other season.
Click and it will display messages like: ``Concentrate and Ask Again.''
And ``Signs Point to Yes.''
``Summer walking'' might take you just about anywhere and make you late for everything else.
