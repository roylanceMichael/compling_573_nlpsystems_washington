This is good news for the space-conscious: A conventionally packaged Shostakovich symphony cycle takes about 5 inches of shelf space; a compact new reissue of Mstislav Rostropovich's recordings of the 15 Symphonies (Teldec 0630-17046, 12 compact discs) takes only 1 inch.
1 and 3, are compilations of dances from Shostakovich's early ballets and movements from his incidental music for the theater, cobbled together by Lev Atovmyan to help raise money for Shostakovich after he was denounced as a formalist in 1948.
Biography and historical context inevitably shape the way listeners understand a composer's music, and in the case of Dmitri Shostakovich, those details are freighted with the nightmarish interaction between the composer and the Soviet state.
Shostakovich's light side sometimes had a biting edge, as in ``Rayok,'' a satirical 20-minute opera originally scored for soloists and choir with piano accompaniment.
Second-guessing Shostakovich's scoring decisions, now a venerable industry, began during Shostakovich's lifetime and with his approval.
Dmitri Kitaenko, conducting the Frankfurt Radio-Sinfonie Orchestra, offers four suites that are as cloud-free as anything Shostakovich composed (RCA 09026-68304-2).
It's hard to imagine, though, that even a listener entirely unaware of Shostakovich's story could listen to his major works _ the symphonies, quartets and operas _ and not get a sense of what he was about.
The work, which parodies Stalin and his functionaries and skewers their artistic pronouncements, was written for the private entertainment of Shostakovich's musician friends and was not published in the composer's lifetime.
It may be a confusing sense, actually: Works seeming to glorify the state mingle with works of bitterness and intensity that seem mainly to evoke struggle and protest.
Also on the disc are the two Suites for Jazz Orchestra, composed in 1934 and 1938.
