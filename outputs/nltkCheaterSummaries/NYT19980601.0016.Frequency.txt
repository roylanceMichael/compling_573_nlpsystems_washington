Qwest Communications International Inc., which is preparing to complete its $4.4 billion acquisition of LCI International Inc., plans to announce its new senior management team Monday.
Besides the ex-LCI executives, almost every member of Qwest's top management team will have come from larger companies, including AT&AMP;T, Lucent, GTE and U S West.
Joseph Nacchio, who left AT&AMP;T Corp. after he was passed over for that company's top job, will remain Qwest's president and chief executive.
Anne Bingaman, LCI's aggressive regulatory affairs chief, is the most senior LCI executive who is not a member of the team that Qwest plans to announce Monday.
Most of LCI's top executives, including its chairman and chief executive, Brian Thompson, will remain with Qwest.
If Worldcom Inc.'s $37 billion acquisition of MCI Communications Corp. wins government approval, the combined Qwest-LCI will become the United States' No.
