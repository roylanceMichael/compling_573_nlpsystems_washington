1/2 ``The Last Days of Disco''  &LR; The third and (the filmmaker swears) last in Whit Stillman's set of three nightlife comedies about preppies who talk smart and live dumb while sorting out their lives and struggling to stay on the right side of cool.
1/2 ``Hope Floats''  &LR; Hope flops as this film never gets off the ground.
1/2 ``Lawn Dogs''  &LR; Not unimaginative, but this attempt to blend social comment and children's fantasy never quite coheres.
``The North End''  &LR; An invigorating debut film from the brother team of Frank and Joseph Ciota, filled with raw freshness, danger, atmosphere and a total avoidance of goombah cliche.
``Home Before Dark''  &LR; Modestly scaled but insightful and affecting take on an 11-year-old girl forced into assuming adult responsibilities when her depressed mother attempts suicide and is institutionalized.
``I Got the Hook-Up''  &LR; This is ghetto comedy as its most crude.
