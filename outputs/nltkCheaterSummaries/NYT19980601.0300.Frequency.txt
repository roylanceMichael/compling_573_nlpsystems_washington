Well, it's not that simple, according to Schor, who continues, ``Many of us are continually comparing our own lifestyle and possessions to those of a select group of people we respect and want to be like, people whose sense of what's important in life seems close to our own.''
Like spoiled children we want what we want, even if we know we can't afford it, even if upscaling means going deeply into debt, even courting bankruptcy.
A large part of Schor's book is devoted to the personal stories of downshifters, people who are voluntarily opting out of the consumer economy, with its stress, debt, lack of free time, and competitive consumption.
The words ``I want ...'' would barely pass my lips when she'd answer, ``Want, want, want.
Schor's own 1994-'95 survey of 80,000 workers employed by a telecommunications company revealed that 27 percent of those in households with incomes of more than $100,000 a year said they couldn't afford to buy everything they need.
Schor writes that competitive consuming took off like a rocket in what she calls ``the decade of greed,'' between 1979 and 1989, when the rich and super-rich took conspicuous consumption to extraordinary levels.
Want is more than ever our master, according to Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor, who in ``The Overspent American'' argues that we are financially and psychologically enslaved by ``competitive consumerism.''
Schor notes that there's no ``typical'' downshifter profile, and her interviews bear that out, though many of the people she talked with had one thing in common: They hated their jobs and were willing to chance almost anything for a change.
Why can't we take a vacation in Bora Bora like those people we read about in last Sunday's travel section?
Many of these consumer dreams are destined to remain dreams, not just because they were unrealistic to start with, but because for most people it's becoming more and more difficult to keep up with rising levels of consumption.
