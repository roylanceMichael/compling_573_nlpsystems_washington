But management officials, clinging to a stance they have held since negotiations began, said Monday that the offer they made on Saturday, which replicates a deal that the city's other transit union overwhelmingly accepted and includes a 9 percent pay raise over three years, was the best the striking union could expect.
PHILADELPHIA _ After three months of fruitless negotiations, the city's largest transit union went on strike Monday, shutting down a nexus of buses, trolleys and subways that serves up to 435,000 people a day.
Certain that no breakthrough was possible, Steven Brookens, president of the Transport Workers Union 234, appeared at a morning news conference to announce that his 5,400 members would walk off their jobs as drivers and maintenance workers at noon.
``We put together a package that represents a wonderful economic deal,'' said David Cohen, SEPTA's chief labor strategist and former chief of staff to Rendell.
They did, and three hours later several hundred strikers staged a noisy demonstration at City Hall and briefly blocked traffic in front of management headquarters.
Rendell said he was especially disturbed that the union would choose the Republicans' first event, a visit to Independence Mall, for a demonstration.
The municipal government and many employers had contingency plans in place for their workers that included private buses, extra cars on the regional railroads that continue to operate and free parking throughout the city.
This was the fifth work stoppage in 21 years, the second in three years; there was a two-week shutdown of the system in 1995.
Even striking drivers expressed uncertainty over a work stoppage that some union members said could last months.
For those who live in the suburbs, the strike meant somewhat heavier rush-hour traffic, and Mayor Edward Rendell predicted that downtown businesses could suffer.
