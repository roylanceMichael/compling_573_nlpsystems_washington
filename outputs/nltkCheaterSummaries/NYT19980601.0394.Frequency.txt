But my friend had said hiking Squaw Peak would be the best way to simulate the ``very strenuous'' conditions of our trip , and morning worked best for my schedule.
Although I like to hike, the longest trail I ever had covered was about seven miles, at Usery Park, near the Superstition Mountains southeast of Phoenix.
(UNDATED) _ During my b irthday party in January, my best friend asked if I'd like to join a group hiking the Grand Canyon in early April.
It's between 8 and 12 miles long (every reference had a different figure, though it's probably eight or nine), and very steep at the beginning, with another very st eep portion about two-thirds of the way down.
Although weather is a lot less predictable at the Grand Canyon than it is here, one usually can count on the temperature at Phantom Ranch (on the floor of the Canyon) being about th e same as it is in Phoenix.
Slowly I got used to the trail, the snow, the crampons and the weirdly beautiful landscape.
Hiking the Canyon would force me to get in shape, clear my head, give me a goal.
Perhaps another trail would be better.
Many writers have tried to capture the Grand Canyon in words; just as many have tried to paint or photograph one of the world's wonders.
I decided I'd hike Squaw Peak two or three times a week for about a month and begin carrying a pack after I had gotten into better shape.
