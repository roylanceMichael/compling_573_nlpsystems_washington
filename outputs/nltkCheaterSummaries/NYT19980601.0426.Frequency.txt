Nick Zito, who lost Halory Hunter five days before the Preakness with an ankle injury, lost his shot at the Belmont Stakes Monday when an ankle injury forced him to withdraw Silver Launch six days before the final race in the Triple Crown.
Kent Desormeaux, who rode Real Quiet in the Derby and the Preakness, was planning to fly from his home in Los Angeles to Louisville to join Baffert and the colt's owner, Mike Pegram, before traveling together to New York.
Real Quiet, who won the Kentucky Derby by half a length and the Preakness by two and a quarter lengths _ both times beating Victory Gallop _ will earn a $5 million bonus if he sweeps the three races.
Real Quiet galloped a mile and three-eighths Monday morning, and will work five furlongs Tuesday before being shipped to Belmont Wednesday.
There was no racing Monday at Belmont Park, but a festive mood was gathering in anticipation of Real Quiet's attempt to become the 12th horse to win the Triple Crown.
Baffert was keeping Real Quiet in virtual seclusion at Churchill Downs before flying his horse to New York tomorrow.
The injury to Silver Launch left a prospective field of 11 for the 130th running of the Belmont, not counting Grand Slam, the winner of the Peter Pan Stakes one week ago.
Grand Slam, winner of the Belmont Futurity and the Champagne Stakes last fall, was severely cut on the leg during the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and did not run in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness.
Most of the other horses preparing to take their shot at Real Quiet were expected to hold final workouts Tuesday or Wednesday after heavy rainstorms Sunday night made the track muddy and forced them to delay their countdown to the main event.
The jockey said he had been pumping Gary Stevens, who rode Silver Charm in last year's Triple Crown, for advice on the final act in the drama.
