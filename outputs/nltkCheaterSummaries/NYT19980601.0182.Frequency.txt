The Stars valiantly rallied to tie it, but the Wings' talent _ not a poor Dallas defensive play, like Richard Matvichuk's on the Detroit's short-handed first goal, or Belfour's incredibly stupid lapse of judgment on the second _ provided the winning goal when Slava Kozlov redirected a Larry Murphy sizzler over Belfour's right shoulder with 8:30 to play.
It wasn't enough that Belfour didn't play his normally impenetrable defense in front of the Stars' net _ and yes, he has probably spoiled us _ but to try to turn LaPointe into a falsetto in front of almost 20,000 fans and a very interested referee, was simply indefensible.
``He's a young guy,'' Wings coach Scotty Bowman said of LaPointe, ``and he's married, too.
Now the Stars find themselves in a place they haven't been before in this postseason, facing an elimination game and the prospect of having to beat the good and serendipitous Wings three consecutive times to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, including at least once in this building in Game 6.
The first came in the opening moments of the game, when the Stars' Mike Modano broke free to the right of the Wings' net, silencing the early bedlam of a jam-packed Joe Louis Arena for a frozen moment as he sent a laser shot streaking toward the goal.
``Eddie wants to see the play, it's in our zone and it's a critical time.
The second, and most ringing moment of all, came less than 10 minutes later when Stars goalie Eddie Belfour snapped during a Wings power play.
``That's the best I've seen Osgood play since I've been in the league,'' Stars' coach Ken Hitchcock conceded.
In full view of an official, Belfour flagrantly rammed his stick, tip up, between the legs of Wings' forward LaPointe, yanked him to the ice from behind and drew a backbreaking penalty that gave the Wings a two-man advantage.
``That's just Eddie,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said.
