``The prices have dropped so fast,'' said Data General's chief executive, Ronald Skates, adding, ``we're just not going to be in a position to design these products for ourselves.''
Instead, Skates said, Westborough-based Data General will focus solely on producing high-end server and data storage systems, which bring in fatter profit margins than do low-end models.
Skates said that there was no room in the company for another 400 employees who designed and built the Thiin Line and low-end Aviion systems.
Skates said that although Aviion sales have continued to grow, the company couldn't find a way to make money on the low-end Aviion servers.
Skates said that Data General will continue to offer a full range of Aviion servers running the Unix and Microsoft Windows NT operating systems.
Compaq is in the midst of acquiring Maynard-based Digital Equipment Corp.    Data General said it will also abandon its Thiin Line Internet server products.
The company Monday laid off 400 workers _ 150 in Massachusetts _ and said it would take a $125 million charge as it abandons the manufacturing of low-end server computers.
Skates declined to say which firms would provide the machines, though he ruled out the possibility that Compaq Computer Corp. would be among them.
According to Skates, the company found that relatively few customers wanted the small, cheap servers, while customers with major Internet sites preferred the high-end machines.
``It's something we hated to do,'' he said, ``but we had no choice.''
