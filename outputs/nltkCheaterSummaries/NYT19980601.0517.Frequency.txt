In the Fifth District, taking in most of Bergen County and the state's northern suburbs, Rep. Marge Roukema, the state's senior member of Congress, is not expected to have too much trouble surviving a challenge from Assemblyman Scott Garrett, 38, in the district's Republican contest.
Of New Jersey's 4.5 million registered voters, 25 percent are registered Democrats and 19 percent are registered Republicans, but any unaffiliated voter may register in either party at the polls on Tuesday and vote in that party's primary.
TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's primary elections on Tuesday have hardly roused much excitement among the voters _ the state expects a minimal turnout _ but the contestants in the two congressional races that have attracted the most attention at least give voters a choice in contrasts.
And in the 12th District, covering the emerging suburbs of central New Jersey from Princeton in Mercer County up into Hunterdon County, Rush Holt, a physicist and university administrator, is the Democratic party favorite, with his name on the party line on the ballot.
The winner will face the Republican incumbent, Rep. Michael Pappas, who is in his first term and deemed beatable by the state Democratic Party.
Those were the kinds of issues Mayer, 39, cut his teeth on as a young volunteer for Ralph Nader, and Nader showed his support in a campaign appearance last month.
Yet Garrett's ardent positions against abortion and in favor of gun owners' rights are issues that draw voters on primary days.
Besides most of Bergen County, the Fifth District takes in parts of Passaic and Sussex counties, Garrett's base.
Mayer has loaned more than $600,000 to his campaign and is running as a maverick outsider championing causes like cutting electric rates and closing corporate tax loopholes.
The winner in the Fifth District will run against Mike Schneider, a former television newsman, who is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
