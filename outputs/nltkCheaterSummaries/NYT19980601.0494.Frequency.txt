Other factors may have prodded Western to acquire a stake in the Royals:    -- Western Resources is in the closing innings of its two-year campaign to acquire Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co., which will need the blessing of state regulators in Jefferson City and Topeka.
Hayes will remain at Westar ``until it's off the ground,'' and he plans to remain involved with Western's investment in the Royals.
His take: Someone had to step forward and make a credible offer to keep the Royals in Kansas City, or the region's prestige _ and economy _ would be harmed, and utilities like Western don't like to serve communities in decline.
-- John E. Hayes Jr., known in the utility world as a consummate deal maker, now wants to add the Kansas City Royals to Western Resources' bulging trophy case.
Budig was on Western's board when it hired Hayes in 1989, but Budig recently relinquished the board seat to avoid an appearance of a conflict of interest on Royals matters.
Gene Budig, president of baseball's American League, said, ``John Hayes is one of enormous ability and unique sensitivity.''
Hunt Sports Group, a Hunt family trust, would be managing partner and would operate the team, while a Western Resources subsidiary also would be half owner.
When a skeptical stockholder recently asked Hayes why the company should own a sports team, ``a rich man's toy,'' Hayes asked for his trust.
Hayes, Western's chairman, pointed out, ``We have a tendency to move the envelope and do things that are not traditional.''
Western is quiet about how it plans to exploit its association with the Royals _ and whether a Westar Field will be the future home of the Royals.
