DETROIT _ With just a shade of curiosity in his mind after Friday's 5-3 Stars' loss to the Detroit Red Wings, coach Ken Hitchcock skated up to defenseman Craig Ludwig at practice yesterday and asked to check the team's pulse.
In the Game 3 loss, the Stars outshot the Red Wings 34-20 and complained that three of the Red Wings' goals never should have happened.
``We've played two strong hockey games (against the Red Wings), we've won one and we've lost one.
``Otherwise, we proved that we can play with this team, that we can play better than this team and that we can beat this team.''
Wings winger Brent Gilchrist used a high stick to play a puck en route to his goal _ a move that should have stopped play, Hitchcock said.
And Stars goalie Ed Belfour said Martin Lapointe slashed him outside of the crease to set up the final goal _ one that broke the back of the hard-charging Stars, who had climbed back from a 4-0 deficit to make the score 4-3.
``We can play that style, we've done it all year,'' said captain Derian Hatcher, in references to the Stars' two previous playoff series.
He said he no longer feels the Stars ``have stopped believing they can win in this building,'' as he said before Game 3.
Still, the Stars' coach said he believes that the team is halfway toward a victory, overcoming the key mental hurdle he perceived was blocking the players in their battle with the defending Stanley Cup champions.
The Stars won a huge game in Texas after the Sharks had pushed the series to 2-2.
