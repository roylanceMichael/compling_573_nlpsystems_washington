As you walk, keep your feet turned out only a little; 15 to 20 degrees is way too far and forces you to lean back to maintain your balance.
Keep your stance as wide as your shoulders to keep from wobbling, which puts stress on your knees.
Your knees aren't car headlights and shouldn't point straight ahead; they should be turned outward a little.
Here are some other suggestions, from Sherry Brourman's book ``Walk Yourself Well'' (Hyperion; $22.95):    Lengthen your stride so you can feel muscles in legs and buttocks working.
Keep your feet straight, not letting your ankles roll inward.
Keep your knees flexible, not locked, as you walk and stand to minimize stress on those joints.
Keep your head up and back.
Does your foot make a print like Donald Duck's, or is the arch clearly delineated?
Don't lead with your hips or your head.
Swing your arms as you walk to help propel yourself; palms should be toward your body, thumbs pointing ahead.
