It is even harder to imagine rooting against him in his twilight years, but the seditious thought occurs that there may actually be more people pulling for his opponents, the Utah Jazz, an admirable and workmanlike team that lost to the Bulls in the final round last year.

All four were members of the original Dream Team in 1992, the first U.S. Olympic squad composed largely of professional players, which won the gold medal in Barcelona with an average victory margin of 44 points a game.

When he finally prevailed against a favored Green Bay team, there was a universal feeling that justice had been served.
