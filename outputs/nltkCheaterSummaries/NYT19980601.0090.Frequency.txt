After a combined half-century of experience, my colleagues in the classroom and I are constantly reminded that we're dealing with people _ unique creations, who need face-to-face communication and human feedback (loads of it), and machines, no matter how 'up-market' or high-tech, or well-connected, cannot get the job done.
In a recent article in Time, Mr. Gore wrote: ``Children in technology-rich learning environments ... developed better writing skills.
Students who are still in the mastery phase of their writing skills do a much better job when the words flow from brain to hand to paper than they do when they're tapping out their essays on a keyboard.
Kids without access to the Internet can't pull up porn pics and run copies of naked ladies in living color to share with 50 of their closest friends.
Mr. Gore is, of course, sincere in his belief that high-tech communications and information systems are going to ``fix what's broke'' in our schools.
Serious writers begin with fat pencils, wide-lined paper, and a teacher who encourages, cajoles, illuminates, and occasionally yells at a budding Hemingway to ``shut up and write.''
I couldn't explain (ITAL)why(END ITAL) the system worked any more than I could have come up with an improved design for a new one, because I had no basic knowledge.
Nor can they hook up with ``chat rooms'' that thrive on the semi-literate blatherings of a bunch of bug-eyed folks who exist only when they're online.
Already, America is sharply divided between those with access to computers and the Internet and those without it.''
Maybe it's because writing by hand gives the learner more time to concentrate on content, more time to think as he works.
