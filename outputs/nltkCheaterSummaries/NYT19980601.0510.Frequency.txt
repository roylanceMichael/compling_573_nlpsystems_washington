NEW YORK _ John Stafford, chief executive of American Home Products, and Robert Shapiro, his counterpart at Monsanto, emphasized on Monday that the $34.4 billion stock-for-stock deal they had just constructed was a merger of equals.
According to figures compiled by Jim Dalton at Compensation Resource Group in Pasadena, Calif., Shapiro will reap nearly $73.6 million in stock option gains from the deal; Stafford's stock option gain will be $48.3 million.
That is because the Monsanto plan was based specifically on characteristics of the company's stock _ volatility, for example _ that will be moot when combined with another company like American Home.
While American Home has a traditional executive pay program that focuses on cash compensation and plain-vanilla options, Monsanto's packages allow for more ownership and more bells and whistles.
American Home's profit margins have been consistently superior to Monsanto's _ operating margins were 25.6 percent versus 22.2 for Monsanto last year.
Although Stafford of the American Home Products Corp. runs the bigger and more profitable of the two companies, Monsanto's man will bag the bigger stock option windfall if the combination goes through.
Upon completion, the deal announced on Monday with American Home Products, which is based in Madison, N.J., will eliminate the risk that Shapiro had in his options plans.
After all, Stafford was paid $6.4 million last year in total compensation; Shapiro pulled in $3.6 million.
In executive compensation circles, Shapiro has been celebrated as a man who holds his managers' feet _ as well as his own _ to the fire, pegging a portion of everybody's pay to the performance of Monsanto's stock.
American Home earned 50 percent more than Monsanto last year.
