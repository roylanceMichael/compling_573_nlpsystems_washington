Unfortunately, some did not do so last month when an armed killer was holed up with a hostage in a service station north of Tampa, Fla.    A Tampa radio station and the St. Petersburg Times drew criticism from law enforcement officers and a journalism ethics scholar for contacting the killer before officers were able to do so.
When law enforcement officers tried to contact him by phone at the service station, the line was busy because Carr had already been contacted by Don Richards, news director for radio station WFLA-AM, who kept the fugitive on the line for six minutes.
The task force was critical of a number of news organizations that got or tried to get phone interviews with Koresh during the early hours of the standoff without the approval of federal negotiators.
``Our negotiators were trying to make contact and (Carr) was on the phone with the radio stations that were trying to get a scoop,'' Hernando County Sheriff Thomas Mylander said later.
Tampa police spokesman Steve Cole said that police finally were forced to call the radio station and ask it to get off the phone.
Amy Ellis, a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times, also managed to get Carr on the line for a brief time.
Carr's rampage began with the slaying of the 4-year-old son of Carr's girlfriend in their Tampa apartment.
A spokesman for the St. Petersburg newspaper, which ran only the first sentence of Steele's statement, was somewhat restrained in his response to the criticism.
It would be very easy to ask the wrong question or say something that would trigger the gunman to harm the hostage or himself or law enforcement officers.''
I served with Steele on a Society of Professional Journalists task force that looked into the performance of journalists who covered the 51-day standoff between federal agents and David Koresh and his followers at their compound outside of Waco in 1993.
