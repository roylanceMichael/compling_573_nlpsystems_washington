As host of PRI's ``Savvy Traveler'' program, he's either traveling the world or advising his listeners on how to do it.
(UNDATED) _ After covering politics and hard news for the Washington Post and ``Washingtonian'' magazine for 22 years, Rudy ``The Savvy Traveler'' Maxa might miss delving into scandals in the nation's capital.
The show's produc er is J.J. Yore, who knew Rudy back in Washington.
What's Monica Lewinsky to a man who once was detained for four hours in Port Said, Egypt, and paid off his captor with $30 cash and a few minutes of fawning    over the general's photos of Mickey Mouse?
Then, Maxa sits at the phone for several hours, laptop and Rolodex at his side, and calls listeners in succession, recording for the next week's show.
Between his radio work, a gig writing a business -travel column for ``Worth'' magazine and writing business-travel columns for MSNBC and abcnews.com, Maxa has to make time to actually take the trips he's still dreaming of.
A year ago, Yore decided Maxa's segments had become so successful they deserved to be spun off into their own show.
Maxa is no Rick Steves, whose public-television series on European travel finds him happily bunking in someone's spare room and counting a hot b ratwurst as fine dining in Berlin.
He once wrote an article for the Washington Post headlined ``A wimp's week in the wild.''
Nine years ago, in fact, Maxa turned down an offer to contribute political commentary to Public Radio Intern ational's ``Marketplace'' series.
