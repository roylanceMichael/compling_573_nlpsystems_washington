I said something really clever, like ``Nice to see you again; I liked your movie,'' and he said something memorable like ``Well, thanks.
And that's actually a pretty good record for a Strait newshound; other longtime country music writers have NEVER scored an interview with him.
By 1992, when he filmed his movie ``Pure Country'' in and around Fort Worth, George was legendary.
He was tallying that interview into his road time, he said, as though he'd punched a time clock.
To date, the sum total of my efforts has been one (1) phone interview, in 1984, and one (1) in-person interview, in 1992.
I covered the world premiere of ``Pure Country'' in the fall of '92, in San Antonio, and was invited to a sumptuous party afterward.
The phone interview in 1984 was a 15-minute conversation done from George's ranch in South Texas, as he and the Ace in the Hole Band were literally loading up to go on tour.
I watched the filming of the concert sequence at Tarrant County Convention Center Arena, and was invited by the movie company publicist to do a ``one-on-one'' with George the following week.
He told me that, no offense intended, he didn't much like doing interviews, and he refused to use his free time to do them.
Later that year, I attended the Country Music Association awards, when George won Male Vocalist honors for the first time.
