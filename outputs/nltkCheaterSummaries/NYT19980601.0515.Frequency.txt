In a recent review, Computer Telephony magazine gave the AQS service high marks, calling it ``very robust,'' ``very cool'' and ``great for startup companies with employees at multiple locations or no dedicated office.''
Incoming or outgoing calls within the Bay Area cost 10 cents a minute, within the rest of California 11 cents a minute and outside the state 16 cents a minute.
&UR;  &LR; Stephen Lange, co-founder of AQS, said one customer using the service is an insurance company with offices in San Francisco, Hayward, San Jose and Oakland.
The Center for Human Function and Work in Boulder, Colo., uses the CrossPoint VirtualPBX to link with a dozen or so professors at the University of Colorado who conduct joint research with the center on work-management issues.
But in case of emergency, it forwards all incoming calls to backup locations, such as home phones, cell phones or satellite offices.
When a caller dials an employee extension, the call is routed to any of several numbers specified by the employee, such as a home number, branch office, cell phone, pager or a client site.
The center began using the service in February and already finds it indispensable, said the center's director, Robert Levin.
Rick Luhmann, the magazine's editor, said he liked the service so much that he subscribed to it for use at his San Francisco office.
The system also comes with voice mail, call screening, dial-by-name directories and a fancy feature called automated call distribution, or ACD, usually found only in high-end systems.
It lets small firms whose employees frequently work from home or on the road look to the rest of the world like a big office with a $100,000 phone system.
