A playwright who bears more than a passing resemblance to his creator and who first appeared in Gurney's 1988 hit comedy, ``The Cocktail Hour,'' Sommer's character smiles hard while quoting sentimental passages from Dickens, enumerating the virtues of his children and listening to a hot-shot young theater director tell him frankly what's wrong with his latest play.
Gurney's new play at the Manhattan Theater Club, it has a beleaguered, on-the-edge quality, like that of a long-persecuted martyr who is finally about to crack.
Though sparked by instances of Gurney's agile wit, the evening, directed by Jack O'Brien, feels mostly like a checklist of concepts, of ingredients that never merge into a natural flow of life.
Gurney has been criticized for the limitations of his plays' subjects, and so, not surprisingly, has John, his alter ego in ``Labor Day.''
This is the world of Gurney, deft chronicler through 20-some plays of the vanishing American species called WASP, and people don't do such things there.
``Labor Day'' finds John defending the world his parents defended to him, trying to hold on to his ``own small circles of civility'' in a turbulent age.
The Land of Gurney is as circumscribed and rule-ridden as that of Jane Austen; his characters may complain, but they certainly don't ``act out,'' especially not in front of an audience.
In this stiff and, by Gurney's standards, strangely awkward comedy, which opened last night, those criticisms are addressed at length.
``Labor Day'' is so busy anticipating what might be said against it that it never gets down to the business of creating full, breathing characters.
This isn't true of the work to which ``Labor Day'' is a sequel of sorts.
