Shouting "murderers," and "You deserve lynching," the crowd demanded to knowwhether their relatives were actually on board the Helios Airways flight ZU522that left Larnaca for Athens International Airport when it crashed at about12:20 p.m. (0920GMT) near Grammatiko, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north ofthe Greek capital.

The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people onboard, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidlystarved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said.
"Although there are precedents for both pilots losing consciousness at thecontrols of the aircraft in the past, for it tohappen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737, withall the backup systems they have there, does seem tobe really quite extraordinary," said Kieran Daly, editor of AirTransport Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry.
