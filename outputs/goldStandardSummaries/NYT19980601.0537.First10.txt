UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ Facing a roomful of union firefighters, Mark Bucher admitted he had not expected a warm welcome, and he did not get one.
Not a single person applauded his introduction.
The applause after his remarks was civil at best.
Then a firefighter stood to rebut Bucher and won a standing ovation.
As one of the authors of the ``paycheck protection'' initiative, which would require unions to get permission from each member before spending that member's dues on politics, Bucher has become an enemy of organized labor throughout California.
Opponents claim the measure's backers want to silence working people and tilt campaign financing in conservatives' favor.
At first, voters seemed not to care.
Only a few months ago, polls showed strong support among even union households.
But that was before labor poured millions of dollars into its ``Vote No'' campaign and staged a comeback that has surprised even some union activists.
