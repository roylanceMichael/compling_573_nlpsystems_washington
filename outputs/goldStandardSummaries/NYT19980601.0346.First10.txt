BEIRUT _ In Saudi Arabia, it's selling on the black market for $30 a pill.
In Egypt, it's banned but costs $15 a pill under the counter.
In Lebanon, no man would even dream of suggesting he needed it _ which is just as well because the government refuses to import the drug until it has conducted tests.
But Viagra has arrived in the Middle East.
In the Arab world, male potency is not a subject you discuss over the dinner table _ or anywhere else _ because many men appear to be obsessed with the subject.
The production of children is regarded as proof of manhood.
A married man without children is constantly and publicly asked _ to the point of harassment _ why he has no offspring.
So is it any surprise that dreams of male virility are now running amok in the region?
Egyptian chemists claim privately that they have been overwhelmed with requests for Viagra, which is one reason why the Cairo police and health ministry officials have been raiding pharmacies in the capital to hunt for the black market drugs.
