SEATTLE _ She worried she would never finish writing the book.
She worried no one would read it when she did.
She worried they would read it and hate it.
She worried no one would show up at the book signings on her 12-city tour.
``I'm very insecure about my writing,'' Judy Blume confesses, spearing a steamed turnip at The Painted Table in downtown Seattle during a lunchtime interview Thursday to promote her steamy new adults-only novel ``Summer Sisters'' (Delacorte Press, 400 pages, $21.95).
Blume, who became a household name after selling an astounding 65 million books for children and young adults, sniffs the turnip suspiciously.
She worries it's an onion.
And she worries onions will upset a delicate stomach.
Her husband, law professor-turned-writer George Cooper, smiles across the table.
