MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Three years ago, Daira Hodges was a 14-year-old ninth-grader and honor student who lived with her family in a middle-class suburb.
``I thought everything was a utopia,'' she said recently, ``I mean, to me, the next-best place to be besides home was school.''
After May 9, 1995, she would never see her world that way again.
Just after lunch that day, a former boyfriend of hers, also 14, dragged Ms. Hodges into a vacant classroom of their academically renowned junior high school and choked her until she passed out.
He then stabbed her 21 times, left her for dead and went to take an algebra test.
But she regained consciousness more than an hour after the attack.
Despite the bleeding and weakness, she managed to make her way into the hall, where a classmate saw her.
She spent a month in the hospital, including two weeks in an intensive-care unit, before she was able to go home.
But Ms. Hodges did more than survive.
