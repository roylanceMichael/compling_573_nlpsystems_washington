WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's decision Monday to focus on the attorney-client privilege to prevent a key aide's testimony could substantially delay the unraveling of the Monica Lewinsky matter.
Although Clinton abandoned his defense of executive privilege in briefs sent to the Supreme Court, he dug in on efforts to shield his closest confidant, Bruce Lindsey, from having to answer crucial questions from independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, in an opinion that cites secret information, has already ruled that Lindsey must answer Starr's questions.
Starr, citing procedures used in the Watergate investigation of President Nixon, has asked the Supreme Court to skip the appeals court level and give an expedited June hearing on the issue.
In its response to Starr, Clinton argued that the question of attorney-client privilege has still not been resolved and requires a full airing at the appeals court level.
``The Supreme Court ought to let the process play itself out,'' said White House counsel Charles Ruff said.
``That's what courts generally do.
This is not steel seizure, this is not Iranian hostages, this is not U.S. vs.
Nixon.''
