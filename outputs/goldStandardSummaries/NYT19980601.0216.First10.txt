Several years ago, Kay West went to the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum to do research before writing the liner notes for George Strait's boxed set, ``Strait Out of the Box.''
She asked for every interview Strait had done and was given a thin folder with a small batch of articles.
Fine, she said.
What year is this?
No, she was told, that's it: total.
All the press on the man who then, as now, was one of the most popular singers in country music.
Three years later, ``Strait Out of the Box'' is one of the most popular boxed sets of all time.
Strait is selling out football stadiums nationwide, averaging 50,000 fans per night without doing any press or TV _ The New York Times, David Letterman, Jay Leno and even Oprah all having asked for an interview and all having been firmly, but politely, told no.
And Kay West sits laughing in her Nashville office.
