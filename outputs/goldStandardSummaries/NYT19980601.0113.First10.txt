CHICAGO _ Merger mania may be running amok in the world of commerce, but in the world of civics the opposite seems to be happening.
Cities and counties dotting the country are in the grip of secession fever.
In California, the San Fernando Valley has been brazenly unfaithful to the city of Los Angeles, doing all it can to get a divorce.
Last month in New York, the rural East End of Long Island filed suit, trying to force the State Legislature to allow it to secede from Suffolk County and form Peconic County.
In Maine, a legislator submitted a bill last year seeking to study the feasibility of making northern Maine the 51st state.
A Maryland lawmaker recently asked his Legislature to let Eastern Shore residents decide if they want to form their own state.
And in March, seeking attention over a nettlesome fishing dispute, people in a sliver of Minnesota called the Northwest Angle got their congressman to propose a constitutional amendment allowing them to secede from the United States and join Canada.
Taking a cue, perhaps, from places like Scotland and Quebec, break-up talk is bleeding into legislatures and city halls.
Some of it is intended to draw attention to neglected issues.
