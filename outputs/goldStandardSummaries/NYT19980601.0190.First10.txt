MANAGUA _ The sky is thickly overcast; the smoke makes eyes water and lungs gasp for breath; the muggy heat is unbearable.
This is the Nicaraguan capital, Managua.
Life was much the same this week in Mexico City, which was on full smog alert.
Honduras reported a continuing sharp rise in respiratory disorders, and until Monday the country's four main airports had all been closed for some days for lack of visibility.
At Tikal, in Guatemala, 700 firefighters were struggling to protect historic Mayan temples.
For weeks now, fires have raged in scrub and forests from Panama to southern Mexico.
Their effects are devastating, and will long outlast the human discomfort.
In Nicaragua alone, a British-aided monitoring program using satellite images has counted many thousands of fires, especially on the Caribbean side, whose forests, stretching across into Honduras, are the last really large area of pristine forest in Central America.
In some places the fire front is 20, 30, even 50 kilometers wide.
