Let's just stop here and say a Holy Moly from St. Jean is praise of the highest order.
He used Holy Moly to express his fascination with malolactic fermentation, and to describe his joy with delicious, complex wines.
Holy Moly is, frankly, as good as any wine term I've ever heard, and it's a lot less snobby.

You can just see ads in the newspaper: ``Chateau So-and-So is proud to announce that its sauvignon blanc earned the prestigious Holy Moly from Garry St.
Jean.''
We made the transition to red wines, or as Riffo said, ``That's enough of chardonnay.
Let's go taste some real wine.''
St. Jean tasted an estate merlot from the barrel.
