It is surprising to find a serene man like Howard Behar in a double-espresso job.
As president of Starbucks Coffee International, the overseas arm of the Seattle-based chain, he has sustained a frenetic pace over the past few months.
In April his firm acquired the confusingly named Seattle Coffee Company _ a London-based chain with 60 stores in Britain _ gaining its first foothold in Europe.
In the past month he has signed deals that will take Starbucks into Malaysia and New Zealand, and has overseen new branch openings in Japan and Singapore.
Meanwhile he has shuttled back and forth to his home in Seattle, a speech at Stanford business school and his son's wedding in Chicago.
Yet Behar does not seem at all frazzled as he talks about his work, combining a decaffeinated demeanor with generous spoonfuls of sweet sentiment.
His primary goal is to improve people's lives, he declares, and Starbucks _ the world's biggest chain of coffee shops, with some 1,600 branches _ is helping him to do so.
First, there are the customers, who can walk into any Starbucks outlet and buy a great cup of coffee, delivered with a smile.
Then there are the employees, who not only earn some money, but also have a chance to feel as good about serving customers as he does.
