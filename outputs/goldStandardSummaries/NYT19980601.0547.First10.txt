NEW YORK _ When visited Monday in his corner office at the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, William Donohue was not burning books.
He was not chopping up reels of film into celluloid guitar picks.
He was not tossing videocassettes into the trash can.
That is because he is not a censor, no matter what some may say, Donohue said.
All he does as president of the Catholic League, he said, is raise warning flags whenever he believes someone has gone over the top in ridiculing Christian dogma or the Roman Catholic Church.
He just happens to be a particularly vigorous flag waver.
``I believe in moral suasion,'' Donohue said at his normal decibel level, which is high.
``I believe in whipping up public sentiment to isolate the offender.
I believe in putting on a lot of pressure.''
