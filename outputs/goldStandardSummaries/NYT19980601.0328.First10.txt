NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''  &LR; _ The key to the success of John Berendt's best-selling book on which this movie is based is its marvelous evocation of Savannah, Ga.
The city is as mysterious as Garbo _ elusive, sexy, dangerous.
The problem with the film is that Clint Eastwood shoots the city as a tourist might, producing beautiful snapshots but not much else.
One of the problems is John Cusack's performance as the reporter-narrator.
He gets in the way of the story of murder, mayhem, and female impersonation.
&UR; ``Oscar and Lucinda''  &LR; _ Gillian Armstrong directs this magnificent story of passion, gambling, and organized religion.
Ralph Fiennes, as the gambling-obsessed cleric, brings a manic intensity, leavened by humor, to the role.
A smart picture for smart people.
&UR; ``Home Alone 3''  &LR; _ Three strikes and you're out at home.
