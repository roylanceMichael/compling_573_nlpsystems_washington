PYLA, Cyprus _ On an island divided by concertina wire and hatred, this may be the only village where ethnic Greeks and Turks live side by side and manage to get along.
The village is tiny, no more than a few hundred people.
And on the only main road is a Turkish mosque, with its Ottoman minaret, and a Greek church, with its red-tiled steeple.
The church's bell tower is newly rebuilt to be slightly higher than the mosque's minaret.
Between the church and the mosque are two cafes that sit opposite each other.
One is the Turkish-owned Kahvehanesi Coffee House and the other is the Greek-owned Trohos Tavern.
The patrons of these rustic-looking, white stucco cafes sit under the shade of verandas and stare across at one another.
The two sides don't talk much, the locals admit, but they stare at one another a lot.
Hasan Mehmet, 70, sat looking out over the stucco arches of the Turkish coffee house sipping a small cup of black and powerful Turkish coffee.
