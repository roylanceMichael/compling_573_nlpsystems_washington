KANSAS CITY, Mo.
-- John E. Hayes Jr., known in the utility world as a consummate deal maker, now wants to add the Kansas City Royals to Western Resources' bulging trophy case.
Hayes admits that Western, which pitches electric current and burglary systems, may be out in left field when it comes to sports.
When a skeptical stockholder recently asked Hayes why the company should own a sports team, ``a rich man's toy,'' Hayes asked for his trust.
Hayes, Western's chairman, pointed out, ``We have a tendency to move the envelope and do things that are not traditional.''
So who is ``untraditional'' John Hayes?
And what drove him to team up Western Resources with sports impresario Lamar Hunt in bidding for the Royals?
The answer is complex, much like the silver-haired, amiable yet sometimes combative Hayes.
Hayes has no intention of becoming a George Steinbrenner on the Plains.
