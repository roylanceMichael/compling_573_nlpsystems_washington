ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines may buy a minority stake in Brazilian partner Transbrasil, which needs fresh capital amid fare wars that followed deregulation of the country's airline industry.
A Transbrasil official told Blooomberg News the carrier is negotiating to sell up to 20 percent of its voting shares.
``We'd get fresh investment and technology, while Delta would get a partner in Brazil,'' said Jorge Honorio, a Transbrasil spokesman in Brazil.
Atlanta-based Delta, which earlier this year bought a 35 percent stake in AeroPeru, declined comment on any negotiations.
But a spokesman acknowledged a continued relationship with Transbrasil is important for Delta's year-old service to Brazil.
``The partnership with Transbrasil and the Brazil service have been very successful,'' said spokesman Bill Berry.
Under their current relationship, which doesn't include any investment by Delta, the two carriers sell seats on each other's flights.
That means Delta can book passengers not just between Atlanta and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two cities where its jets fly, but also to Transbrasil's destinations within Brazil.
Transbrasil, likewise, can book passengers on Delta's U.S. flights.
