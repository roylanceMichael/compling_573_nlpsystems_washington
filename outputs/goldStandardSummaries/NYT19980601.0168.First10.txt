BALTIMORE _ Left-handed hitters often served as a source of torment for right-hander Aaron Sele during 1997.
Those demons appeared exorcised during his first nine starts this season with the Rangers.
The past two appearances suggest otherwise.
Sele, who last night failed in his bid to become the major leagues' first nine-game winner, surrendered home runs to two left-handed hitters during the first three innings of Baltimore's 6-3 victory at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
``I buried this team early,'' Sele said after the Rangers' fifth consecutive loss and his shortest appearance this season.
``I put us down five runs.''
Left fielder B.J.
Surhoff and designated hitter Harold Baines, two of five players in the Orioles' lineup who hit left-handed against Sele, sent two curveballs on 400-foot journeys.
Surhoff's three-run blast consummated the Orioles' four-run first inning, and Baines connected for a one-out, solo home run during the third inning that gave the Orioles a 5-0 advantage.
