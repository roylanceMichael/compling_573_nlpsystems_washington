``Before I leave work, I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old son, Will, has been up to,'' says Michael Johnson, a general manager at a printing company in Portland, Maine.
``Then when I come home, I can tap right into Will's world.
I'll say, `I hear you were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today.'
It lets him know I have been thinking of him.''
Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between their work life and their family life.
Nearly 70 percent of working men say that family is just as important as their job, or more important, according to a national Roper Organization survey.
As a result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
In fact, 46 percent of fathers today say they don't spend enough ``quality time'' with their children.
And when they're unable to do this, 78 percent of men say they feel guilty, according to a survey of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio's University of Toledo.
