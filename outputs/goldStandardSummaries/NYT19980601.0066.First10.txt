ATLANTA _ It looks like Windows 98 will be released on Microsoft's original schedule of June 25.
My guess is that the publicity about the company's problems with the Justice Department will end up hyping sales.
After all, most home users will figure a program that attracts so many headlines must be danged important.
So my job today is to be a real TechnoBuddy and urge you not to rush to buy Windows during the first month or so.
This has nothing at all to do with the merits of Windows 98.
Sooner or later, you'll upgrade.
But there are compelling reasons to wait out the initial rush to install the newest version of Windows.
First, you can expect the technical support telephone lines at both Microsoft and even at retailers will be jammed with calls for help during the first few weeks Windows 98 is available.
Installing a new operating system is like dumping two jigsaw puzzles into one box and then trying to separate them.
