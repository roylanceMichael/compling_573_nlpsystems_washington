NEW YORK _ Nine love letters that are to be sold at auction in New York later this month reveal a liaison that took place between Albert Einstein and a married Russian woman in the United States in the closing months of World War II that may have been a good deal more dangerous than the physicist ever realized at the time.
All the letters were written by Einstein, the father of the theory of relativity, to Margarita Konenkova between 1945 and 1946.
They have been passed on to Sotheby's, the auction house, by an unnamed relative of Konenkova.
With other mementoes of the affair, they will be sold on June 26.
The missives reveal a man smitten with a woman who at the time was married to the Russian sculptor, Sergei Konenkov.
She had apparently also had had an affair with Sergei Rachmaninov.
Whether the relationship began before or after the death in 1936 of Einstein's second wife, Elsa, is not clear.
Much more likely to stir fascination in the sale, however, are suggestions that Konenkova was a Russian spy and that introducing Einstein to Soviet diplomats in New York was part of her mission.
Konenkova's secret side was, according to the New York Times, uncovered first by Paul Needham, a consultant to Sotheby's.
