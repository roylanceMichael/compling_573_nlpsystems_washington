NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis of George Washington met Monday night with Ed Manetta, St. John's athletic director, becoming the fourth coach to interview for the Red Storm's head basketball job.
Manetta also spoke with Davidson's Bob McKillop, Siena's Paul Hewitt and St. Bonaventure's Jim Baron last week.
Jarvis was on Manetta's short list two years ago when the school hired Fran Fraschilla, but he did not interview for the job.
He has a 253-141 record in 13 seasons as a Division I head coach.
Jarvis, who coached at Boston University for five years and the last eight at George Washington, reportedly earned about $600,000 last year.
The Red Storm is paying off settlements to both Fraschilla and Brian Mahoney.
