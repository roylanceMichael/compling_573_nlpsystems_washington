TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's primary elections on Tuesday have hardly roused much excitement among the voters _ the state expects a minimal turnout _ but the contestants in the two congressional races that have attracted the most attention at least give voters a choice in contrasts.
In the Fifth District, taking in most of Bergen County and the state's northern suburbs, Rep. Marge Roukema, the state's senior member of Congress, is not expected to have too much trouble surviving a challenge from Assemblyman Scott Garrett, 38, in the district's Republican contest.
Yet Garrett's ardent positions against abortion and in favor of gun owners' rights are issues that draw voters on primary days.
Ms. Roukema, 68, with 18 years in Congress, styles herself as a fiscal conservative but is more of a centrist on social issues.
The winner in the Fifth District will run against Mike Schneider, a former television newsman, who is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
Besides most of Bergen County, the Fifth District takes in parts of Passaic and Sussex counties, Garrett's base.
And in the 12th District, covering the emerging suburbs of central New Jersey from Princeton in Mercer County up into Hunterdon County, Rush Holt, a physicist and university administrator, is the Democratic party favorite, with his name on the party line on the ballot.
He is running against the personal fortune and aggressive campaign style of Carl Mayer, a former Princeton Township Council member.
The winner will face the Republican incumbent, Rep. Michael Pappas, who is in his first term and deemed beatable by the state Democratic Party.
