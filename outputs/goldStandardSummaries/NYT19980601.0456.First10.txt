ATLANTA _ His son was not even four, but Jeff Burroughs knew there was something special about him.
He knew when Sean could barely handle a fork and spoon but could pick up a bat, his little elbow cocked in perfect position, and whack one ball after another off a tee.
He knew when Sean was not even toilet-trained, but could stand 20 feet away and throw a baseball right into daddy's glove.
Like the father of Tiger Woods, Jeff Burroughs, a former Braves player, knew.
``Sean was so natural, even back then,'' Jeff said from his home in Long Beach, Calif. ``He picked things up so easily.
I guess you can say it was like he was born with a bat in his crib.''
Of course, that's really no surprise; it's all in the genes.
The older Burroughs, 48, once was one of the major leagues' best power hitters.
He won the American League MVP for the Texas Rangers in 1974 and then played in Atlanta in 1977-80.
