NEW YORK _ As all readers of ``The Wind in the Willows'' know, Mole, Rat and Badger are ever the most agreeable of companions.
And if Toad of Toad Hall is sometimes self-absorbed and silly and in need of a good talking-to, well, that makes life among the characters created by Kenneth Grahame in his classic tale of friendship in the English countryside all the more enjoyable.
So it is surely a pleasure to see these eternal friends brought to life once again, this time in the equally agreeable New Victory Theater, where an ambitious musical version of the 1908 children's novel is playing through June 14.
If this collaboration between the upstate resident theater company Syracuse Stage and professors, recent graduates and students of Syracuse University falls somewhere short of the pure enchantment and innovative Orwellian political vision of last year's short-lived film version, it is nevertheless a colorful, cheery, tuneful and spirited return to Ratty's river, Toad Hall and the unfriendly confines of the Wild Wood.
As adapted and directed (with Anthony Salatino) by Gerardine Clark, a professor in the Syracuse University Drama Department who also wrote the intelligent lyrics, this production hits the high spots of the novel.
These include the meeting of Mole and Rat; their truncated outing with Toad in his gypsy caravan; the beginning of Toad's motor-car mania; Mole's excursion into the Wild Wood; refuge with Badger; Toad's jailing and escape; the takeover of Toad Hall by the weasels and stoats, and the friends' ultimate triumph.
The youthful cast is a definite plus.
Both as a singer and as an actor, Eric Collins makes a delightful Mole; the clear-voiced, athletic Timothy A. Fitz-Gerald proves an agile Rat, and Michael Poignand creates a properly dignified, wise and thoughtful Badger.
Lee Zarrett works hard as Toad, and Price Waldman makes a strong impression as the magistrate who sentences the imprudent Toad to 19 years in prison.
