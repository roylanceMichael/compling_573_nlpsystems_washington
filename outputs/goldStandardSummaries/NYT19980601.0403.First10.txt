Mary Ann Rafferty didn't know she had eye problems.
``I just wanted a new pair of frames,'' she recalls.
``But when the doctor examined my eyes, I knew by the look on his face that something was wrong.''
A few more tests confirmed that Rafferty had glaucoma, a disease in which too much fluid pressure builds up inside the eye and damages the optic nerve.
More than 3 million Americans have glaucoma, and 80,000 are blind because of it.
``My whole world turned upside down,'' Rafferty says.
``At 41, all I could think was that I was too young to go blind.''
Luckily, her condition was caught early enough to save most of her sight.
Two surgeries have allowed Rafferty, now 49, to see well enough to continue working for a pharmaceutical company in Berkeley, Calif.
