For years, the yen was one of the world's strongest currencies.
No longer.
This week it hit a seven-year low of YEN 138 against the dollar _ 40 percent down on three years ago.
To some, this is yet more evidence of Japan's deepening economic mess, and a bad harbinger for the outside world, too.
Worries that a falling yen could prolong Asia's financial crisis have helped push Wall Street sharply lower.
Yet such sentiments are misplaced.
The weaker yen will not be a cure-all, but it is likely to do more good than harm.
Which is more than can be said for the measures that would be needed if policymakers were to set out to make it stronger.
The recent fall in the yen largely reflects the relative stance of monetary policy in Japan and the United States.
