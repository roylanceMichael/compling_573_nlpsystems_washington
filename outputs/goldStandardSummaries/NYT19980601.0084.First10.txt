ATLANTA _ Sooner or later, Madeleine Albright, the first female secretary of state, was bound to have a public brush with chauvinism.
Surely there was a touch of it in the comments of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) when he declared for the benefit of the world _ and especially Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu _ that Albright was nothing more than an ``agent of the Palestinians.''
Can anyone imagine Gingrich saying that about Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker III, Warren Christopher?
The historical myth that prevented women from serving in high foreign-policy positions is that they would be too easily influenced, too weak.
It was a gender thing.
Aside from picking on Albright, Gingrich, the history professor, knows the first lesson of statesmanship is to share foreign policy concerns of a delicate nature with the secretary or the president privately.
But Gingrich hardly qualifies for the list of Georgians in Congress who have distinguished themselves on foreign policy: Sen. Walter George, who won high praise from President Dwight D. Eisenhower for his bipartisan approach; Sens.
Richard Russell and Sam Nunn, for instance, both of whom advised Republican and Democratic presidents.
Gingrich claims to have learned a number of lessons the hard way in his book,''Lessons Learned.''
