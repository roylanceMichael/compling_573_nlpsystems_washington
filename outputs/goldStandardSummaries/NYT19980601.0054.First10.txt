CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan tried so hard not to call it a ``guarantee'' or a ``promise.''
Whatever term he wanted to use for his prediction _ ``We're going to win Game 7,'' he had said two nights earlier _ he backed it up.
Not with one of his vintage scoring outbursts, but with alert passing, timely rebounding and a complete handcuffing of his nemesis and the Indiana Pacers' sometimes-hero, Reggie Miller.
Jordan did all that, and because he did, the gimping, geezing Chicago Bulls are still defending their NBA championship.
The Bulls on Sunday night won the seventh and deciding game of the Eastern Conference finals 88-83, and finally moved on to play the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals that open in Salt Lake City on Wednesday.
The Bulls, faced with playoff elimination for one of the very few times since they began their string of titles in 1991, needed every jumper, every loose ball, every defensive stop and every whistle in their favor to hold off the Pacers before an alternately tense and raucous United Center crowd.
But most of all, they needed Jordan, who had only played in one Game 7 during the championship years (in 1992, when the Bulls defeated New York in the second round).
He delivered with 28 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, and kept Miller scoreless in the fourth quarter.
Jordan shot &LR; ju  &LR; 9-for-25 from the floor and 10-for-15 from the line, but he also grabbed two crucial rebounds in the final two minutes.
