NEW YORK _ A bedraggled Bronx garbage heap _ heretofore a place for dumping stolen cars and, at least once, a human body _ will become a $22-million city-owned golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, city officials said Tuesday.
The course, the first new one in the city in 35 years, is planned for an undeveloped section of Ferry Point Park, in the shadow of the Whitestone Bridge.
Despite its municipal ownership and landfill locale, it will aim for a measure of exclusivity.
The developers _ led by Nicklaus, one the sport's most revered figures _ say the course and its amenities will be of country-club caliber.
The number of golfers will be strictly limited, and the price will be almost twice the cost of a round on the other city-owned courses.
The plan, scheduled to be formally announced today by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, could be a boon for the growing number of golfers in the city and the region.
With the sport's popularity rising, playing on one of the city's existing public courses can often be an ordeal, with tough competition for a tee time and near-gridlock on the fairways.
``We'll do something special for the Big Apple,'' Nicklaus said in a telephone interview Monday.
He has created a preliminary layout for the course based on pictures and maps of the site, but will see the location in person for the first time Tuesday.
