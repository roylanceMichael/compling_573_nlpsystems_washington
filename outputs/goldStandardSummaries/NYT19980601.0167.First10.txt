In the very first scene of ``Almost Heroes,'' Chris Farley is on the gallows, telling the crowd what it can do with his fat rump.
Not only is the scene a creepy reminder of his recent death, it's a reminder of how he lived his life: not caring much what anyone thought of him, and willing to do anything for a laugh.
Too often, Farley did the most extreme things for a laugh.
His philosophy seemed to be that no matter how lame the line, bellowing it would make it funny; no matter how weak the sight gag, if Farley screamed and abused himself enough, maybe you'd at least crack a smile.
Farley does a lot of bellowing and screaming in ``Almost Heroes,'' but nobody could have saved this script, written by a trio whose names don't merit looking up.
Although a few laughs come through, this story of a cut-rate Lewis and Clark ultimately defeats normally dependable talents, including Matthew Perry and Eugene Levy, with its disjointed gags and aimless story.
But it's director Christopher Guest who suffers the biggest defeat.
Less than a year after his ``Waiting for Guffman'' made some of 1997's 10-best lists, he's delivered a movie that's a good bet for 1998's 10-worst lists.
Maybe Guest needs to write his own material when he directs; whatever the case, he winds up with a movie about cross-country exploration in which everyone in the cast seems to be going in a separate direction, and nothing seems to click.
