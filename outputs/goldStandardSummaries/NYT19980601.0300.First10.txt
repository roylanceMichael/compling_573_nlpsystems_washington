When I was a little girl my grandmother always said the same thing whenever I'd ask her to buy me something.
The words ``I want ...'' would barely pass my lips when she'd answer, ``Want, want, want.
Want will be your master.''
Grandma was wise, as usual.
Want is more than ever our master, according to Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor, who in ``The Overspent American'' argues that we are financially and psychologically enslaved by ``competitive consumerism.''
We know we spend too much money on stuff we don't really need.
We read about it, we hear about it, we talk about it, we complain about it.
But most of us keep doing it.
So while Schor's book is interesting, with some important things to say about the excesses of consumerism, you have to ask: Will she succeed in persuading readers to change their ways, to ``downshift'' their lives in the direction of less work and less spending?
