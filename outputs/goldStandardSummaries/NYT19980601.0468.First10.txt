BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Milo Djukanovic of Montenegro celebrated his governing coalition's sweeping victory in crucial parliamentary elections on Monday, ensuring his domination of a government that will defy integration with Serbia.
The victory is considered certain to widen the schism between Djukanovic and the government in Belgrade led by President Slobodan Milosevic.
The elections for the 78-seat parliament were seen by many as a referendum on whether Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up the present Yugoslavia, should stay in the Yugoslav federation.
The defeat of Momir Bulatovic's Socialist People's Party, financed and backed by Milosevic, means that Belgrade will now have to use other means, perhaps a state of emergency, to keep Montenegro from drifting toward secession, Western diplomats said.
With 94 percent of the vote in Sunday's elections counted, the Montenegrin Election Commission said the coalition led by Djukanovic had taken 49.5 percent of the vote.
Bulatovic's Socialists won 36.07 percent, and the Liberal Alliance, which openly calls for secession, won 6 percent, with the balance split between smaller parties.
The governing coalition is expected to get about 40 seats in Parliament, with about 30 for Bulatovic's Socialists.
Djukanovic is also expected to receive support from the Liberals and ethnic Albanian legislators to give him an unassailable majority.
``Montenegro has again shown that it has the wisdom, courage and resolve to resist those who decided to enslave Montenegro,'' Djukanovic, 36, told cheering supporters outside Government House, adding:    ``This is not our final victory.
