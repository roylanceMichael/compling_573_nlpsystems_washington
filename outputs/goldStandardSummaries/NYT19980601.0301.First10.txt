WASHINGTON _ On the question of whether to testify under oath before a grand jury about his relationship with former White House aide Monica Lewinsky, President Clinton cannot win.
The president has apparently decided to continue rejecting Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's efforts to grill him about his contacts with Lewinsky and his knowledge of those mysterious 37 visits she paid to the White House after leaving her job there.
Although Clinton has already rebuffed at least four grand jury invitations for his voluntary testimony, Starr is currently stepping up his pressure to get the president on the witness stand.
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly said Sunday that subpoenaing the president or indicting him was an option being considered, an ominous hint of just how far Starr may be prepared to go.
But either draconian move would be both legally and politically dubious.
Most experts believe a sitting president cannot be indicted.
Instead, the procedure used in cases of alleged presidential misconduct is impeachment.
And should Starr issue a subpoena to compel testimony, it would be a stunning, historic presidential first that could not be enforced.
(The constitutional separation of powers bars the judicial branch from imprisoning a sitting president.)
