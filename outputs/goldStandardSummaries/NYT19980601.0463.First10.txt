(Undated) - Summer's almost here, and once again drivers of    older cars are wondering whether there will be any Freon left to recharge their air-conditioners.
Not to worry, say Valley air-conditioning experts and mechanics.
The refrigerant is not only readily available but it's actually cheaper than it was last summer.
``The price is down and supplies are plentiful,'' said Ward Atkinson, a Scottsdale air-conditioning specialist.
Just a few years ago, the outlook seemed grim: production of the refrigerant R-12, known as Freon, would ce ase in 1995, forcing motorists everywhere to endure an expensive conversion of their automobile air-conditioners to use a new generation of refrigerant.
That's because the world supply of Freon, a chlorofluorocarbon banned because of its suspe cted role in depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer, would disappear.
But that hasn't happened.
Production of Freon is banned, all right, but instead of supplies evaporating, the refrigerant is readily available and should stay t hat way for years to come.
Atkinson credited the stockpiling of the chemical by automakers, dealers and mechanics; an aggressive recycling program; and reduced usage of R-12 as older cars are taken off the road.
