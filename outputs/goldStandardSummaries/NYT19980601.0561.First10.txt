SALT LAKE CITY _ The invitations surprised Bobbye Sloan.
Her husband wanted her to come into the locker room after his team, the Utah Jazz, won the Western Conference finals.
He wanted her to ride the team bus back to the hotel.
In 35 years of marriage to Jerry Sloan, and to basketball, she had never felt so included, not in victory or in defeat.
She thought to herself, do I know this man?
``Jerry just always believed that's not where family belongs,'' she said.
``He thought it was a distraction.
Our son wanted to be a ball boy once, and he said, `Absolutely not.'
It wasn't part of his thinking.''
