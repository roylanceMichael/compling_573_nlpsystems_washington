FATAL-CRASHES (Los Angeles) _ Double-digit declines in alcohol-related deaths and injuries drove highway fatalities in California last year to the lowest level in 38 years, the CHP says.
More driver and alcohol education, and higher compliance with seat-belt laws are credited with the decrease in fatal accidents.

LA-SURFS-UP (Los Angeles) _ Surf is up across Los Angeles County beaches, and lifeguards have been busier than usual plucking unwary swimmers and surfers from the ocean.
And if recent days are any measure, the beaches will be ready: More lifeguards are on the job than in recent years because of a push to hire, and even though El Nino's fury damaged the beaches, the maintenance budget has been enough to make necessary repairs.
A heavy surf advisory continued today on south-facing beaches due to 5-to-8 foot swells, and waves up to 10 feet, generated by a storm in the South Pacific.
