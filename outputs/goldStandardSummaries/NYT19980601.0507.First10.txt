Sprint Corp., the No.
3 long-distance telephone carrier, plans to announce Tuesday its long-awaited strategy for competing in local communications markets, executives close to the company said Monday.
The strategy is based on an ambitious plan to deliver high-speed access to cyberspace, the executives said.
Tuesday's announcement comes after Sprint has spent the last two years essentially sitting on the sidelines in terms of competing in new local telephone markets.
The company seems to have spent that time devising some new tactics for use in the continuing battle between long-distance and local phone companies.
A person close to Sprint said the company was hoping to cooperate with the five Bell local telephone companies rather than attack them head-on.
That cooperation could take the form of Sprint's agreeing to buy capacity on advanced local data networks that many of the Bells are planning to build.
Bell Atlantic Corp., which offers phone service for much of the area from Virginia to Maine, and SBC Communications Inc. appear to be the Bells that are negotiating most seriously with Sprint, a person close to Sprint said.
As they await permission from regulators to sell long-distance service within their traditional local telephone regions, Bell Atlantic and SBC each have already signed contracts with Sprint to buy wholesale capacity on Sprint's national fiber optic network.
