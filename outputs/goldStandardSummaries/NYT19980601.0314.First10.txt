Priscilla E. Muller can remember the name, but not the face, of the man who walked through her door Jan. 26, 1995, asking her to authenticate what appeared to be a centuries-old, gem-studded rosary.
So many people bearing jewels allegedly recovered from shipwrecks come in asking Muller, curator of the Hispanic Society of America Museum in New York City, to identify their treasures that she can't possibly remember them all, she says.
Muller does recall telling the man the rosary design appeared to be similar to that found in Spain's New World colonies 250 years ago.
That was about it.
The museum prohibits her from outright authenticating an artifact or allowing herself or the museum to be mentioned in any promotional material.
So she was somewhat taken aback last week to find herself being quoted on the Internet as praising the authenticity of the very same piece of jewelry _ now up for sale for $75,000.
``The whole field of treasure hunters is replete with people simply looking for money.
I find it all quite troubling, more so because the field is growing,'' says Muller, who is retiring after 30 years at the museum.
Treasure hunting is booming as a result of better and better technology for finding long-lost wrecks, creating not only a growing market in recovered artifacts, but an intensifying battle over whether it's just good business or a greedy rape of our archeological past.
