Godzilla was going about his business in a Times Square theater one afternoon last week when he discovered a murdered infant godzilla and shrieked in anguish (118 decibels).
Then he was strafed by fighter jets (105 to 115 decibels for five minutes).
Finally, he died (67 decibels).
As a wave of ear-splitting summer movies arrives at theaters, ears ache or hiss or buzz the way they do after a rock concert.
The moviegoers to whom they are attached wonder whether it's just their imagination or whether the volume of the soundtrack was at jet-engine levels.
Almost: Jets take off at an eardrum-rupturing 150 decibels.
``Of course movies are louder than they used to be,'' said Leonard Maltin, the critic for the television program Entertainment Tonight.
``It's a question of whether it's an entertainment or an assault.''
Either way, it is the result of the digital-sound age, which has brought hiss-free soundtracks and multi-channel systems with more knobs and meters than an airplane cockpit.
