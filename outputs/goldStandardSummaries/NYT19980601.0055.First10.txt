SAN FRANCISCO _ It was something old, something new Sunday at the Escape From Alcatraz triathlon.
Chris McCormack, a rookie Escapee, held off fellow Australian Greg Welch to win the swim-bike-run competition in 1 hour, 59 minutes, 56 seconds, just six seconds in front of the defending champion.
Meanwhile, Michellie Jones, another Aussie, took control of the women's competition on the eight-mile run leg and coasted to her second straight Alcatraz victory with a 2:12:55 clocking, nearly a minute and a half ahead of runner-up Barb Linquist of Wilson, Wyo.
McCormack's and Jones' victories were in the come-from-behind category, and it was the opening swim phase, a 1.5-mile trudge through the waters of San Francisco Bay, that separated the two from the other competitors.
``That was a hard swim,'' said McCormack, a 25-year-old from the Sydney area who has been competing in triathlons for four years.
``I didn't know where I was.
I got lost, and I didn't know where to go.
I was really annoyed.
I spent the whole swim alone.''
