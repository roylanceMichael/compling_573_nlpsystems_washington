DETROIT _ Bring on the dead octopuses.
They can't be near as rancid as what the Stars threw out on the ice for the first two periods last night at Joe Louis Arena.
Smelly.
Slimy.
Putrid.
You couldn't find a week-old, dead eight-legger more rotten than a Stars team that not only forgot what got it here, but got caught up trying to out-Wing the Red Wings, connoisseurs of the fly-and-sigh offense, and failed miserably.
And then, for 15 minutes of the third period, the Stars nearly scared the scarlet britches off the defending Stanley Cup champs and their fans, who sat stunned by a furious Stars rally that might have turned into the biggest comeback in franchise history if not for one final ignominious moment by goalie Eddie Belfour on easily his worst night of the playoffs, if not his life.
If Game 2 was a must-win contest for the Stars, then the Red Wings' humiliating, 5-3 thumping of the intruders from Texas guarantees even more desperation hockey in Game 4 tomorrow afternoon with Detroit leading the best-of-seven series 2-1.
This game was over five minutes into the second period when, in an 80-second span, the Wings pumped two goals past the nearly comatose Belfour for a 4-0 lead.
