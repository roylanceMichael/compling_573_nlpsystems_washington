In the frenzied closing hours of this year's gubernatorial primary, four battling candidates delivered what has been largely lacking in the 1998 TV-dominated campaign: color, excitement, talk about issues and face-to-face appearances before thousands of real live voters.
Democratic front-runner Gray Davis was fired up and emotional Sunday before a receptive congregation at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles _ and talking like a winner.
A spirited Rep. Jane Harman, fueled by internal polls suggesting she is gaining on Davis, barnstormed the state in a six-seat airplane filled with powerful female backers, arguing for ``bold leadership'' on education, gun control and health care.
Businessman Al Checchi finished up a statewide school bus tour _ seemingly oblivious to polls showing him in last place _ with a push for the Latino vote, crooning ``Guantanamera'' to the strains of a mariachi band in Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, state Attorney General Dan Lungren, all but unopposed for the Republican nomination, was relaxed enough to joke about how his campaign against Davis might go.

Instead, the candidates at last let their guard down _ giving voters a glimpse of the personalities and passion at the heart of their quests.
