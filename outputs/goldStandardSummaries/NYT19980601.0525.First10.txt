The best advice I ever got on that score literally walked in my front door one day, when a trio of local inventors showed me an interface that plugged a PC into our typesetting machine.
For a trivial cost, their invention more than doubled the amount of text our machines could pump out.
Thanks to that little gadget, our mom-and-pop shop was able to compete with big type shops nationwide for book and newsletter contracts.

When customers call, they want you now.
Answering services, pagers and cell phones are just the start.
Maybe you need a service that forwards calls from your ``headquarters'' to a cell phone.
