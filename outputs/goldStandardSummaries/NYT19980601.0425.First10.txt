WASHINGTON _ The nation's census for 2000 already has politicians playing the numbers game and the stakes are enormous.
President Clinton enters the debate Tuesday in Houston on the side of the Census Bureau and Democrats who want a new counting method they claim will better tally minorities and poor people left out of the 1990 census.
But Republicans, who claim the new method is unconstitutional, hope to put the issue before the Supreme Court this fall.
At stake are billions of dollars in public and private funds.
``This is by far going to be the most controversial census ever,'' said a Republican staff member involved in the battle.
The last major census controversy was in 1920 when the population count revealed more Americans living in cities than the country for the first time.
Rural lawmakers refused to procede with the reapportionment that would have cost them control of Congress.
Clinton will appear Tuesday at the Magnolia Multi-Service Center near downtown Houston to hold a round-table discussion with business executives, minority leaders and academics to talk about the impact of the 2000 census and the need for an accurate count.
It will mark the first time Clinton has entered the census fray.
