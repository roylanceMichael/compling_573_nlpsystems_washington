WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday dropped the claims of executive privilege he had invoked in the Lewinsky investigation, moving to reduce the prospect of a quick Supreme Court review in the highly charged constitutional clash between the White House and the independent counsel.
But the president continued to press claims of a lawyer-client privilege to sharply limit the questioning of Bruce Lindsey, one of Clinton's closest confidantes.
And the Justice Department filed its intention Monday to appeal a lower-court ruling that ordered Secret Service agents to testify.
The legal maneuver over executive privilege, approved by Clinton at a meeting Monday morning with his lawyers, was an attempt by the White House to narrow its appeal so as to rob the Supreme Court of an opportunity for a fast review, as independent counsel Kenneth Starr has sought.
If the tactic works, it could prolong the legal wrangling between the president and the independent counsel for many months.
Moreover, there were fresh signs Monday that even if Starr ultimately succeeds in defeating the attorney-client claims, he would be unlikely to gain any incriminating evidence against the president from Lindsey.
In a footnote in the White House brief filed Monday with the Supreme Court, administration lawyers said that Lindsey, a close friend of the president's for three decades, had already told the grand jury that he ``had no information that anyone had committed perjury or obstruction of justice.''
Lindsey and many other senior and junior Clinton aides have been called before the grand jury that is examining whether the president or anyone else illegally sought to coverup Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
The White House had argued in March that a broad array of questions asked of Lindsey and another presidential aide, Sidney Blumenthal, could not be answered because they intruded on the fundamental right of the president to get confidential advice from his aides, a principle enshrined in the law by the courts as executive privilege.
