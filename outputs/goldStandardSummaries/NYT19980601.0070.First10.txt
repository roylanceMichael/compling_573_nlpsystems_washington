RICHMOND HILL , Ga. _ Henry Ford, billionaire titan of the Industrial Age, once found 1,800 acres' worth of tranquillity along the shores of the Ogeechee River outside Savannah.
Now, a group of developers hopes those same acres will offer vacation homes, as well as chic and sporty diversion to new Wall Street millionaires of the Technology Age.
Construction on the first houses is expected to begin in mid-June, pending approval by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Variously called Dublin Plantation, Sterling Bluff and Richmond Plantation, the property now renamed the Ford Plantation will be the first development of its kind in the Savannah area.
A group of South Carolina investors called Sterling Bluff Associates is positioning it as the Bar Harbor of the South or the Ocean Reef Club of Georgia, offering second or third homes and presumably attracting families of wealth and station similar to those that frequent the Maine and Key Largo, Fla., resorts.
``There are only so many people that fit that profile.
Buyers will either add this to their list of destinations, or forsake an existing resort for this ... (but) it sounds like it would sell,'' remarked Eric Kennedy, editor of the duPont Registry, a magazine catering to buyers of million-dollar residences.
The developers include co-managing directors Steve Schram and Peter Pollak.
Schram is the agent for Sterling Bluff Associates, which was incorporated March 19 in Hilton Head, S.C.
