NEW YORK _ The smile, to tell the truth, is a little scary.
Worn fixedly by Josef Sommer in ``Labor Day,'' A.R.
Gurney's new play at the Manhattan Theater Club, it has a beleaguered, on-the-edge quality, like that of a long-persecuted martyr who is finally about to crack.
A playwright who bears more than a passing resemblance to his creator and who first appeared in Gurney's 1988 hit comedy, ``The Cocktail Hour,'' Sommer's character smiles hard while quoting sentimental passages from Dickens, enumerating the virtues of his children and listening to a hot-shot young theater director tell him frankly what's wrong with his latest play.
The smile may be part of an armor of willed benevolence for a man who has recently been seriously ill, but you half expect this guy to pull a pistol out of his well-worn khakis and start shooting anyone in his line of vision.
Nothing of the sort happens, of course.
This is the world of Gurney, deft chronicler through 20-some plays of the vanishing American species called WASP, and people don't do such things there.
The Land of Gurney is as circumscribed and rule-ridden as that of Jane Austen; his characters may complain, but they certainly don't ``act out,'' especially not in front of an audience.
Gurney has been criticized for the limitations of his plays' subjects, and so, not surprisingly, has John, his alter ego in ``Labor Day.''
