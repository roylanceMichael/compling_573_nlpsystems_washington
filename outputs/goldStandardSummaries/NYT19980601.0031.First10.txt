_ The first rule of Dirtbag baseball is that nothing ever comes easy.
The second rule is that it takes someone tough to deal with rule number one.
And as editions of 49er baseball go, the 1998 team has qualified as one of the toughest.
Sunday night, facing elimination here in the College World Series, the 49ers dug themselves a 4-0 hole against Florida State but then rallied for a 7-4 win that gains them a rematch against Miami Tuesday night.
This is the team which began the season 2-8 and had its right to be known as Dirtbags questioned by Coach Dave Snow.
Qualifying for the CWS earned it a place in the Dirtbag Hall of Fame.
Staying alive in it moves it into more select territory.
``We've been resilient all season,'' said Snow afterward.
