NEW YORK _ While graduates of York College in Queens basked in sunshine and congratulations at their commencement, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's policies took a drubbing Monday.
The mayor did not attend the event.
What made the occasion contentious was the vote last Tuesday by the CUNY board of trustees, at the mayor's urging, to discontinue remedial classes at the 11 senior colleges in the system, including York.
They also voted to exclude any student who has not passed placement tests in reading, writing and mathematics.
The plan is scheduled to be phased in over three years, beginning in September 1999.
Alfred Curtis Jr., a trustee who has supported the campaign to phase out remedial courses, was drowned out by boos and catcalls Monday morning at York, in Jamaica, as he tried to express greetings from fellow trustees.
Many graduates rose to their feet, shaking their fists and pumping placards with slogans like, ``Education Is a Right, Not a Favor.''
Critics say the new policy will prevent thousands of students from entering college.
Giuliani and other supporters have said that the policy will raise academic standards.
