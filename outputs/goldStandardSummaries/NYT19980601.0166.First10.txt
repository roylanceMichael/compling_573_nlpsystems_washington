Deion Sanders underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left ankle yesterday in Miami, the Cowboys announced.
Dr. John Uribe removed a bone spur from the cornerback's ankle.
The injury occurred over time, Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said.
Sanders underwent a similar operation in 1995.
Recovery and rehabilitation time will take from four to six weeks, Maurer said.
That means Sanders could miss the beginning portion of training camp when the team convenes in Wichita Falls in mid-July.
In three seasons with the Cowboys, Sanders has attended training camp only once, in 1996.
When he was originally signed before the 1995 season the Cowboys were already through with training camp and last season he played baseball while his teammates practiced in Austin.
The operation could hamper the plans of first-year Cowboys coach Chan Gailey to include Sanders in the offense.
