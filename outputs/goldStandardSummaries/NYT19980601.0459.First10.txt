The tongue-wagging, Michael Jordan who goes after his sixth, and perhaps last NBA title this week, first surfaced the third day of the Chicago Bulls' training camp in 1984.
Kevin Loughery, then head coach, remembers the moment like it was yesterday.
``What happened was we gave him the ball in a drill, one on one, against the whole team, and he immediately started going through guys, killing 'em,'' Loughery recalls.
``We knew he was a great athlete, but we didn't know he had all those skills.
We knew we had a terrific prospect, but really, we didn't know what we had.''
The Bulls knew this much about Jordan, who would become the league's scoring champion 10 times: ``He was a better shooter than given credit for,'' Loughery said.
``He worked all day at it.
But then he started going one on one, scoring all kinds of different ways -- in the post, jumping over people, outside.
I looked at Rod Thorn, and he looked at me, and we knew there was something very special here.''
