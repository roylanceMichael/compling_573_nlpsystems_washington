NEW YORK _ Audiovox Corp. and the Bosch Telecom unit of Robert Bosch GmbH of Germany plan to announce Tuesday the availability of a wireless telephone that can operate on different continents without modification.
The new phone is based on a digital technology known as global system for mobile communications, or GSM.
While other technologies are more popular than GSM in the United States, GSM is the dominant digital wireless technology overseas, especially in Europe.
Omnipoint Corp., which provides wireless service in the New York area using GSM technology, plans to announce that it is offering the new phone Tuesday.
George Schmitt, president of Omnipoint's wireless operation, said the phone would probably cost $299 and would let users make and receive calls in foreign countries as if they were at home.
People who use Omnipoint and other GSM wireless carriers can often do those things already, but they generally must first get a special phone for use abroad.
``It basically makes it a lot simpler for our customers to roam around the world,'' Schmitt said.
``It's equally important that people coming here from overseas be able to get a clear service.''
The GSM Alliance, a group made up of 13 North American GSM wireless companies, said the new phone could be used in more than 110 countries.
