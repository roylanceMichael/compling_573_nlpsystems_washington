LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; How can you tell if you're walking properly?
Take a look in the mirror.
Do you lean to one side?
Are your shoulders straight?
Do you lead with your head?
Your hips?
Or take a walk barefoot on wet sand.
Do your heels sink in evenly?
Or is there a deeper depression on the outside of your foot, or the inside?
