A group of Little League moms were discussing the chores their kids did.
One mother said her son made his bed every morning, folded laundry and cut the grass.
Another said her son prepared his own breakfast, vacuumed the rugs, updated the family's Web page on the Internet and rotated the tires on the car.
I was pretty dizzy by the time the third mom spoke, but I think she said her 12-year-old son had recently re-marcited the pool, performed an emergency appendectomy on the family cat and restructured their stock portfolio, but that he was ``not perfect'' and sometimes needed to be reminded to pick up his socks.
As if the heat, the dust and the hard bleacher seats were not enough.
As if I don't have anything better to do than eat stale popcorn, sip watery Mountain Dews and shout ``good eye!''
whenever a batter refrains from swinging at a pitch that is 10 feet over his head.
As if all of this were not enough, I now have to deal with the possibility that my son may be ``chore deficient.''
Until I overheard the Little League moms, I didn't realize that one could be deficient in chores, just as one could be deficient in vitamin A, vitamin C or thiamine.
