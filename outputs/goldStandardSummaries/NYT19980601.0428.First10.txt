When the life of a hostage is at stake, the news media need to butt out.
Unfortunately, some did not do so last month when an armed killer was holed up with a hostage in a service station north of Tampa, Fla.    A Tampa radio station and the St. Petersburg Times drew criticism from law enforcement officers and a journalism ethics scholar for contacting the killer before officers were able to do so.
The actions of the two hurt the credibility of all the news media at a time when journalists cannot afford such damage.
You probably read about Hank Earl Carr's deadly rampage on May 19.
What you probably did not hear about was the deplorable performance by the radio station and the newspaper, because it drew little national attention.
It should have.
Carr's rampage began with the slaying of the 4-year-old son of Carr's girlfriend in their Tampa apartment.
Carr was arrested but managed to slip out of his handcuffs and kill two Tampa homicide detectives who were accompanying him in a car.
In his flight north from Tampa, he killed a state trooper before abandoning his car and taking a 27-year-old female clerk hostage in a service station.
