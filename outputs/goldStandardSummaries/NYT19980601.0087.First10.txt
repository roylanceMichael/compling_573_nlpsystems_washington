One neat thing about summer is the way it can be put in front of another word to suggest something fleeting and not to be taken seriously.
Is that literature?
No, it's summer reading.
Are those kids getting serious?
No, it's just a summer romance.
Is this an engaging and thoughtful film that shimmers with unexpected insights into the human condition?
Naw, just a summer movie.
You mean he's finally getting to work at school?
No, he just wants to hang out in the student union and meet girls in summer dresses in summer school.
