DELHI _ With the detonation of two more nuclear devices in Baluchistan Saturday, Pakistan's declared number of tests is now seven _ two more than India's this year.
The demand of my Karachi taxi driver two weeks ago for ``six tamashas'' (dazzling exhibitions) to outdo India's five was thus gloriously fulfilled, and the ferocious sibling rivalry between the world's two newest nuclear weapons states was acted out on the biggest and most fearful stage of all.
India and Pakistan are not conventional enemies, militarily or in any other sense.
A sort of malignant magic seems to entwine the two countries, tainting and poisoning their endeavors, shackling them to one another, hobbling their destinies, forcing them endlessly into confrontation.
Never better than cool, their relationship is more tortured than comparable enmities _ North and South Korea, East and West Germany _ across borders of the Cold War.
One reason for that is the religious divide which led to the creation of Pakistan.
The ghosts of the hundreds of thousands on both sides who died during the Partition that brought the two states into existence half a century ago seem to haunt them still.
After India conducted its nuclear tests, Pakistan followed suit as quickly as possible.
That much was predictable: the neighbors have, after all, fought three wars in the past 50 years, all of which Pakistan has lost.
