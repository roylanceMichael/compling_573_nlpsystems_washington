TUCSON, Ariz. _ Sen. John McCain is accustomed to uphill battles.
As a young fighter pilot downed over North Vietnam, he survived more than five years as a prisoner of war.
As a first-term senator, the Arizona Republican overcame a media pounding regarding his association with corrupt savings and loan mogul Charles Keating.
And earlier this year, he defied his own party's leadership to champion an overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
Now the unpredictable politician who has been toying with running for president in 2000 has taken on another daunting task.
As the chief sponsor of mammoth anti-smoking legislation, McCain has been waging a war with the nation's tobacco titans.
The measure has made the former two-pack-a-day smoker the darling of the public health community and ally of the Clinton administration, which wants to take a more aggressive role in cracking down on teen-age smoking.
But it has also stirred up hard-core conservative voters in McCain's party who are deeply suspicious of the steep tobacco price increases and new federal regulations.
The tobacco companies and smokers' groups have flooded McCain's home state with ads contending that the legislation is a big government tax scheme that would result in a black market for cigarettes.
