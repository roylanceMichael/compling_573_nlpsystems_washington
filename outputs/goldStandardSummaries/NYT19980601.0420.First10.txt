SEATTLE _ Three Seattle artists _ two writers who teach in the creative writing program at the University of Washington and a video artist _ are among the 29 winners of this year's ``genius grant'' fellowships conferred by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
Seattle winners of the prestigious awards are Linda Bierds, a 53-year-old poet from Bainbridge Island who is chair of the UW's creative writing program; Charles Johnson, the 50-year-old novelist and National Book Award winner who also teaches in UW creative writing program; and Gary Hill, a 47-year-old video artist with an international reputation.
The MacArthur awards, which are shrouded in secrecy and speculation, are intended to honor creativity in all fields of human endeavor.
They confer, over five years, a six-figure grant with no strings attached, in hopes of spurring time and resources for recipients to devote to their work.
The actual amount conferred is determined by the fellow's age.
Bierds will receive a grant of $320,000, Johnson $305,000 and Hill $290,000.
Bierds and Johnson Monday expressed surprise and delight at their selection, which they learned of last Wednesday but had to keep secret until the awards were announced.
Hill was unavailable for comment Monday.
Bierds said she was in the midst of preparing a grilled cheese sandwich at her home when the call came from the MacArthur Foundation office.
