CHICAGO _ Ask Hendrik Verfaillie, president of the Monsanto Co., about the benefits likely to emerge from the announcement on Monday of Monsanto's proposed merger with the American Home Products Corp., and he turns the clock back four years.
That was when executives in the agricultural chemicals operations of Monsanto and the American Cyanamid Co. talked about co-developing crops capable of surviving sprays of their competing herbicides but could not agree on how to split costs and profits of such an arrangement.
The talks failed.
Now, thanks to the acquisition by American Home Products of Cyanamid's agribusiness last year, such roadblocks will not exist if the deal announced on Monday is completed.
``That's the most exciting part for me,'' said Verfaillie, who will head the combined agricultural operations of the merged company from St. Louis, where Monsanto is based.
New products that can attract premium prices from farmers, the faster development of drugs using biotechnology, crops designed to yield healthier food _ these are among the visions driving the Monsanto-American Home Products merger.
Behind them all, as Verfaillie's anecdote highlights, is the realization that even big businesses such as Monsanto are having a hard time keeping up with the opportunities and challenges erupting from biotechnology research around the world as scientists unlock the secrets of genes _ the basic building blocks of all life.
The breakthroughs could lead not only to huge new markets, environmental benefits and more plentiful food around the world, but also, if mismanaged, to ecological disasters.
Monsanto has been among the world leaders in the race to create ``life science'' companies, enterprises driven by the assumption that food, drugs and a wide variety of industrial and energy products in the next century will be based on understanding how genes are structured and how they perform their functions.
