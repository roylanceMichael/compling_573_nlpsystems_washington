&UR;  &LR; COLEBROOK, N.H. _ Last Aug. 19, a hole was ripped in this town's heart.
Carl Drega, his soul full of rage and arms full of semi-automatic weapons, murdered four people.
&UR;    &LR;  Drega killed New Hampshire state troopers Les Lord and Scott Phillips first, as they sought to question him about the dilapidated state of his pickup and threats he'd made against District Judge Vickie Bunnell.
&UR;  &LR; Then Drega drove to Bunnell's office.
He killed her as she ran.
When newspaper editor Dennis Joos tried to wrestle the gun away, Drega turned it on him.
In New Hampshire, Colebrook is the tragedy by which people measure time.
There is Before Colebrook, when such things were inconceivable.
And then there is now.
