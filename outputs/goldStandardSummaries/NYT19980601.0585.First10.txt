PITTSBURGH _ Hideo Nomo is looking for work.
Brian Bohanon would rather start than relieve.
And Bill Pulsipher is chafing at Norfolk over the possibility of pitching in the major leagues again.
All of which means Dave Mlicki should be looking over his shoulder about now.
On one of the strongest staffs in the majors, Mlicki has been the weak link.
Monday night, another poor outing by the 29-year-old right-hander helped break the Mets' string of nine straight victories.
Mlicki (1-4) allowed four runs, three of them earned, in six innings in a 4-3 loss to Jason Schmidt (8-1) and the Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium.
The hole Mlicki dug for them led to the end of the Mets' longest winning streak in nearly seven years and was just too deep for them to overcome, even though they rallied for three runs in the last two innings.
In losing for only the second time in 13 games, about the only things that went right for the Mets were Mike Piazza's first home run with the team, which spoiled Schmidt's bid for a shutout with two out in the eighth, and three more hits from Carlos Baerga, who is now batting .306.
