Paramount Pictures began early press and sneak screenings of ``The Truman Show'' months ago, hoping to get out the word that this was not another slapstick Carrey movie along the lines of ``Ace Ventura: Pet Detective'' or ``Dumb and Dumber.''
The studio was successful at building considerable audience awareness and positive word-of-mouth.
Esquire ran an advance story calling The Truman Show ``the movie of the decade.''
Paramount was also testing the waters to find out how to market its unusual film, mindful of the relative disaster that occurred when Carrey first tried a satire, the dark ``The Cable Guy.''
That 1996 movie finally managed to make $100 million worldwide, far less than anticipated.
Carrey's fans _ those who loved him in slapstick films _ were not pleased with his portrayal of a character in whom the comedy was scary and strange.
``It's just a shooting gallery sometimes,'' Carrey says.
``It's just your time to go in front of the guys with the guns.
It was politics, a lot of things.
