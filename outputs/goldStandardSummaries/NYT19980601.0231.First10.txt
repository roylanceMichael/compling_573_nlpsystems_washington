BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ We arrived in Belfast a week before the peace referendum in Northern Ireland, for a ceremony lauding John as the first Ireland Professor of Poetry.
Always, coming into Belfast, one is struck by how small a battleground it is.
Just a few streets west of the city center, which resembles any bustling English town, lie the Unionist enclave Sandy Row, and the Nationalist Falls Road, literally side by side.
Barbed wire and bombed-out or dilapidated houses characterize both areas.
The only apparent difference between them is the murals adorning the sooty brick walls.
Along the Falls, one sees Che Guevera and other political crusaders, making it clear that the Catholic extremists regard themselves as freedom fighters, while the Protestant murals depict the defiant, blood-red hand of Ulster, and ``King Billy'' on his white horse few Unionists seem to know that King William of Orange was supported in his campaigns by the pope.
Belfast is a microcosm of the tensions racking the end of our century, the walls between the Shankill and Falls a miniature of the former Berlin Wall, its sectarian strife as hard to decipher as Algeria or Yugoslavia, the pastor Ian Paisley, with his gross historical simplifications, a Protestant version of the Ayatollahs.
But while religion has been a source of conflict in the North of Ireland, it has also provided a name and central symbol for the referendum which was passed last week: the Good Friday agreement.
This agreement will try to remedy the division of Ireland, which began with a famous event bearing another religious name, the Dublin Easter Rising of 1916.
