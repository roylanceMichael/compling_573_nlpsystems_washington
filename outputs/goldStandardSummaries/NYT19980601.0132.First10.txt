&UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;    Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that they panic.
It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e., tacky.
Your mother is sure she knows what's correct.
Your beloved's mother has her own ideas, and your neighbor down the street can't wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she's attended.
