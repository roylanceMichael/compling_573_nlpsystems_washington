LOS ANGELES _ Q.
In a recent staff meeting, the director of purchasing reminded all of us that if our work hours are 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., we are to keep those hours.
We are salaried employees but were told that regardless of whether we come in an hour earlier to catch up on work, we cannot leave any time before 4 p.m.
However, there are some employees who are ``exceptions'' to this rule, but the director will not let me move my hours.
What do you suggest I do?
S.M.
A.
The director is using a managerial philosophy from George Orwell's ``Animal Farm'' in which all employees are equal, but some are more equal than others.
Unfortunately, when management demands adherence to company rules and then allows certain ``exceptions,'' it is a sign of other managerial problems, including a lack of trust, respect and credibility.
