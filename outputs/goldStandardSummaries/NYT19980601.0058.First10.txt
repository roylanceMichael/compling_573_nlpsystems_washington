SAN FRANCISCO _ June has arrived with a schedule full of land mines for the Giants.
They have three more games at St. Louis, where Mark McGwire plays even bigger than his frame.
They have seven meetings against the first-place San Diego Padres, and four interleague games against the A's, who always find a way to give them a searing pain behind the temples.
The best thought the Giants can carry into battle this month is the knowledge that they just completed a 19-11 May despite some visible chinks in their armor.
For the past 10 days they have put on a Monty Python clinic on how not to run the bases.
First baseman J.T.
Snow and right fielder Stan Javier still haven't found their strokes, and catcher Brian Johnson is just beginning to rediscover his, as he showed with two solo homers in Sunday's 7-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
If the question is whether the the 33-24 Giants are playing as well as they can, manager Dusty Baker would answer with an emphatic ``no.''
``In my mind we're not on a great run yet,'' he said.
