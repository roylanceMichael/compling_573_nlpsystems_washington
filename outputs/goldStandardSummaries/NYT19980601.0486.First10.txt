NEW YORK _ Nearly 100 fights and 27 years ago, Roberto Duran arrived in New York, a 20-year-old Panamanian lightweight with a 25-0 record and the sneering snarl of a Caribbean pirate in an old Errol Flynn movie.
All he needed to fit the part was a bandanna around his head and a knife between his teeth.
And in his Madison Square Garden debut on Sept. 13, 1971, all he needed to dispose of Benny Huertas was 70 seconds.
``It was a dream for me to fight here,'' he said Monday with a soft smile that soon turned into that old sneer.
``But when I walked around the city, nobody knew who I was.
I told myself, `The next time I come here, they're going to know me.'''
The next time, he arrived as the challenger for the world lightweight title, then held by Ken Buchanan of Scotland.
``I remember seeing Buchanan eating a piece of bread with butter and drinking a Coke,'' Duran recalled through Juan Rolon, his interpreter.
``They asked him why he hadn't looked at films of my fights and he said, `Duran's too slow for me.'
