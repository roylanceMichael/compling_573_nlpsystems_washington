The people of New Orleans love to eat.
And now the people of New Orleans love to diet.
The Sugar Busters diet is all the rage in the city of etouffee and remoulade, where a survey recently concluded that a third of the people are overweight.
Now in bookstores nationwide, the Sugar Busters diet _ high on protein, low on carbohydrates _ was designed by a vascular surgeon, two gastroenterologists and an oilman in New Orleans.
They say their self-published book sold more than 200,000 copies its first month.
Some of the best restaurants in New Orleans, including Commander's Palace, now serve Sugar Busters specials _ such as a large pork chop on a small mountain of sweet potatoes pureed with spicy sausage and nestled on a lake of spinach, sauteed with bacon.
What's not on the Sugar Busters menu are sweets, including the sugars in such dietary superstars as carrots, rice and pasta.
Sugar Busters is only the latest in a line of trendy high-protein/low-carb diets, with names like Protein Power and The Zone.
All are simply variations on the Atkins diet, launched in the early '70s by Dr. Robert Atkins.
