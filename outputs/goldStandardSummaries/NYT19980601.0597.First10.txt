PHOENIX _ Genius?
Him?
Bill McDonald thought it was a joke when he answered the phone Wednesday at his isolated ranch near the Mexican border.
Yeah, right, he thought, as the caller said he'd been picked to receive a ``genius grant'' of $285,000 over five years from the MacArthur Foundation f or his work forging compromises among ranchers, environmentalists and government agencies.
But the call (begin ital) did (end ital) sound like it was long-distance.
McDonald's hand went numb.
Then he thought about his tax consulta nt.
``My God, my taxable income has just tripled,'' McDonald said of his first reaction.
Such are the problems that follow good deeds, said Sandy Eastlake, executive vice president of the Arizona Cattle Growers Association.
