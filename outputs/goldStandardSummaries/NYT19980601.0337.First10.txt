People with bad health habits that they will not or cannot abandon often make excuses: ``What's the point of living longer _ you'll only spend more years in a nursing home?''
or ``A healthy life really isn't any longer, it just seems that way.''
Perhaps the saddest excuse of all dates back to 1964 when the surgeon general issued the first report on smoking and health.
Diehard smokers told me, ``By the time I get lung cancer, they'll know how to cure it.''
If only that had happened.
But 34 years later we are hardly closer to curing lung cancer than we were then.
The fact is none of these excuses hold up under the scrutiny of sound medical research, and a recently published study of more than 1,700 men and women followed for 32 years puts the lie to them all.
The study, published in April in The New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that people with healthier habits not only live longer, they live better, experiencing only half as much chronic disability as their less-prudent age mates.
The findings strongly suggest that vitality into one's later years is less a matter of genes and more a question of how a person chooses to live.
