CHICAGO _ There were frayed edges on his greatness and dents in his mystique, but Michael Jordan did not care about appearances at this moment.
He dropped the finesse and elegant beauty of his game on Sunday night and barged in between the Pacers and their grasp on the Bulls' dynasty like a bouncer.
It was evident in the last three tense minutes in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals played out before an unsettled crowd at the United Center.
There was the moment when Jordan tossed his tired body into the air and crashed into the chest of his series menace, Derrick McKey.
Jordan was the one left standing.
There was the instant that he sneaked inside of the brawny Dale Davis and grabbed a rebound off a missed free throw by Scottie Pippen.
A possession was saved.
This was not the polished Jordan, not when he made 9 of 25 shots on his way to 28 points, but there was the poise of the ultimate winner when face to face with a game that could have meant the end to the Bulls' era.
A loss and this team might have been dismantled on the spot.
