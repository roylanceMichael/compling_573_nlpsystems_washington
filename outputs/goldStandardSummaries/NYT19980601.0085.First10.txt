ATLANTA _ Throughout Western Europe, roughly a million vending machines dispense Coca-Colas.
That's a pretty tame business; people drop in their coins and Cokes come out.
What could go wrong?
Maybe everything.
And soon.
That's because the machines are set up to accept coins minted by the many different countries of Europe.
But starting Jan.1, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and seven other European nations will launch a massive effort to withdraw all existing coins and bills and replace them with a single new currency, called the euro.
When the conversion is completed in 2002, there will be no more Italian lira, or German marks or French francs.
Only the euro will be used to conduct business in all 11 countries.
