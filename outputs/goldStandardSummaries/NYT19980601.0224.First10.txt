LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Walking.
Putting one foot in front of the other.
It's one of those basics, like learning not to shove peas up your nose or put gum in your hair, that we all learned as babies.
There we were, crawling across the carpet and using the edge of the coffee table to pull ourselves upright.
Suddenly one day, we let go.
Hey, ma, I'm walkin'!
In an instant, we were independent, upright human beings able to toddle, then run, leaving our frantic parents scrambling behind us.
When we fell, we got up again and walked bravely into the rest of our lives.
As teens, guys perfected that I'm-so-cool slouch, and girls developed the ingenue sashay, leading with their hips like runway fashion models and sexy young movie stars.
