&QL;   &QL;   &UR; !!!
``Home Before Dark''  &LR; Modestly scaled but insightful and affecting take on an 11-year-old girl forced into assuming adult responsibilities when her depressed mother attempts suicide and is institutionalized.
Impressive central performance by Stephanie Castellarin in a sterling debut film by Maureen Foley.
(Unrated)    &QL;   &QL;   &UR; !
1/2 ``Hope Floats''  &LR; Hope flops as this film never gets off the ground.
It wastes the sweet appeal of Sandra Bullock in a skeletal and predictable story about a woman retreating to her Texas hometown in pain and confusion after being dumped by an unfaithful husband.
The movie mopes around more than she does.
(PG-13)    &UR; !
``I Got the Hook-Up''  &LR; This is ghetto comedy as its most crude.
