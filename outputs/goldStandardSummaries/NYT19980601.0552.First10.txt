Alan Rothenberg, the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, caused a bit of a stir last week when he said he did not expect the United States national team to advance past the first round of the World Cup.
Rothenberg's comments came during a news conference to announce the ambitious Player Development Opportunity as part of the federation's Project 2010.
That's 2010, as in the year the United States would (hopes to, expects to) win the World Cup.
The objective, Rothenberg said, is to identify and then train players at a younger age, providing the educational and financial support that will get the best players to skip college (even leave high school) to play professionally.
With financial backing of more than $50 million from Nike and the International Management Group, the federation hopes to house up to 120 players full time in the under-17 group, initially, at the Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Fla.
Developing soccer players in the United States has always been a bit serendipitous, and there are no guarantees of world-class talent emerging even though millions of children are playing the game.
What's more, unlike the rest of the world, the best athletes in America are far more interested in the big-money sports, like basketball, baseball and football.
Around the world, the biggest, strongest and fastest athletes in most countries play soccer first.
Not here.
