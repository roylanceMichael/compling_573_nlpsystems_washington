In politics, as in science, pundits are always on the lookout for a unified theory, preferably a single idea that binds together an otherwise disparate constellation of facts and events.
For the seemingly endless stream of revelations that constitutes America's campaign finance scandal, no explanation is as seductively simple _ or sinister _ as the China plot.
It has all the elements of a Manchurian Candidate remake: The mink-coat-wearing daughter of the top Chinese general.
A frantic search for satellite technology and missile guidance systems.
Intercepted communications that suggest a Beijing-directed scheme to suborn American politicians.
And lurking behind the scenes, the People's Liberation Army, a one-time peasant force that some see as the American military's one potential peer in the coming century.
Look through the eyes of those who follow China most closely, however, and the best of those plot lines falls flat.
``I was a skeptic from the beginning and I remain a skeptic,'' says James Mulvenon of the Rand Corp. in California, a specialist on the Chinese military and its commercial ventures.
``When you have a sense of how China works, it is hard to see these scandals as anything but an unfortunate series of coincidences, not a plot.''
