LOS ANGELES _ If you have a tough enough time every Sunday night unraveling the complex threads of a vast government-alien conspiracy involving shadowy figures with mysterious powers bent on subjugating the world, just wait until you try the X-Files interactive computer adventure game.
All seven CD-ROMs of it.
The massive X-Files game is out there, or at least it will be in a few days, arriving in stores a week or so ahead of the theatrical release of ``The X-Files'' movie and about three weeks after the end of the smash television show's fifth season.
Think of the game as a way to get your X fix all summer.
With an 800-page script that has numerous possible endings, depending on your choices and attitudes, and takes 30 to 40 hours to play through each time, there's enough to keep a game Xer, or X gamer, occupied until the new season starts in the fall.
``To have a game with seven CDs is just insane,'' said Bill Paris, a video-game writer and columnist for Next Generation and PlayStation magazines.
``That's a new one on us.''
The sheer size of the game, which is being billed as another episode of the show, is staggering compared to other games on the market, which seldom need more than two or three CD-ROMs to contain all their elements, said Paris.
And the space has been well-used.
