SLOATSBURG, N.Y. _ The law people cite most often in this village these days is the one that says precisely what kind of housing is allowed: single-family houses on lots of 40,000 square feet, single-family houses on 30,000 square feet, single-family houses on 15,000 square feet and single-family houses on 10,000 square feet.
Period.
The word ``apartment'' appears only to describe something that may exist on the second floor of a single-family house, and then only by permit.
Nowhere do the words ``big condominium town house project'' appear, and villagers have been crowding town meetings this spring to keep it that way.
They are trying to derail a plan by Mayor Samuel Abate to bring the first multifamily housing to a village filled with people who came here to get away from the very idea.
Sloatsburgers are willing to have change and growth _ to a point, said Becky Kern, a leader of the Little Town Forum for the Historic Preservation of Sloatsburg, a group formed to resist Abate.
``We don't want change that will bring us to a future of jammed roads, overcrowded schools, vinyl-clad boxes piled three and a half stories high and a shopping center that looks like every other strip mall,'' she said.
This view puts Mrs. Kern and her allies squarely in the mainstream of a national reaction against high-density row house developments like the one K. Hovnanian Enterprises, the biggest town house developer in the country, hopes to build in Sloatsburg.
It is an opposition that seems a far cry from an early acceptance of suburban town houses, when they first began appearing in large numbers in the 1970s, as sensible, affordable and _ because they reduced sprawl _ environmentally friendly starter homes for young couples, or as step-down homes for empty-nesters.
