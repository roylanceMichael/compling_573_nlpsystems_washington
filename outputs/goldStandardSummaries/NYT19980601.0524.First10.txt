Billy Blue, a San Francisco men's clothier, provides a more optimistic model for cyber retailers: While its total online sales have been relatively small, the site has sold more upscale apparel in the past two months than Saks did in its 18 months on the Web.
``Saks will come back when they realize they made a mistake,'' says Billy Bragman, owner of Billy Blue.
Billy Blue is just one of 700,000 small businesses with some type of Web presence and one of 70,000 with secure ordering capability, according to International Data Corp. Thousands more small companies, defined as those with fewer than 100 employees, are signing on each month.
No one knows how many of these sites are profitable.
As with large retailers, it is possible for a small business to sink hundreds or thousands of dollars into a Web site and see little or no return.
For many of the early entrants, profits aren't even expected until significantly more consumers are spending considerably more money on the Web.
The three Bay Area merchants profiled below have each established a presence on the Web with some degree of success.
_Billy Blue ( &LR; www.billyblue.com &LR; ) has sold $7,000 worth of Web merchandise in the last two months, including four horsehide coats for $695 each and numerous packages of underwear.
(By contrast, Saks sold less than $3,000 of merchandise in a year and a half.)
