The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 2:    &QL;    You know you are on new economic terrain when the White House decides to rush out a pronouncement on Russia on a Sunday, not because of some impending Russian government action but in hopes of influencing financial markets to be more inclined to lend money to the Moscow government.
President Clinton's efforts to jawbone Russian markets were, at least initially, no more successful than previous presidents' efforts to talk up U.S. financial markets in times of crisis.
Panicked investors are not inclined to be reassured by vague promises of support, such as the White House offered when it said the United States would back ``additional conditional financial support from the international financial institutions, as necessary, to promote stability and structural reform in Russia.''
The most important word in Clinton's statement was ``conditional,'' and it points us toward the real game that is being played here.
The president is supporting the current international policy of delaying a large bailout until there is evidence of real reform.
In plain language, the United States and the International Monetary Fund want Russia's government to prove that it can collect revenues even before the badly needed reform of the tax code makes its way through the Russian parliament.
Pressure in the opposition direction _ that is, for a bailout now _ is coming from the big investors who regret going into Russia and have driven down the Russian stock and government bond markets.
It is a dangerous and expensive game, but in the absence of a major collapse, Clinton is right to press for internal reform as a prerequisite for aid.
All that makes it important for Boris Fyodorov, the country's new tax czar, to step up collections.
