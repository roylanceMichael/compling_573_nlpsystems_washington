Policy    Will U.S. Be Drawn Into War on Rebels?
Administration officials have played down fears that the United States is being drawn deeper into Colombia's guerrilla war.
The Pentagon recently said it would tighten safeguards meant to keep aid from going to forces involved in human-rights abuses, and promised new scrutiny of the ``joint combined exchange training'' in particular.
Under an agreement signed in August, Colombian military units can receive U.S. support only after their rosters have been screened to determine that they do not harbor troops known to have violated human rights with impunity.
Officials said only two battalions of the Colombian army have qualified so far, and both of those have had to be assembled from other forces.
Another key condition cited by U.S. Embassy officials is that U.S. aid can only be used in a designated region of Colombia where the ties between drug producers and the guerrillas are held to be so close that any rebel unit could be fairly considered the traffickers' ally.
There was no question that the definition of the zone was broad: ``the box,'' as it was described by U.S. diplomats, encompassed almost the southern half of the country.
Yet officials said the area was not big enough for the Pentagon, which has quietly refused to acknowledge its limits.
``In terms of geography, the use of the resources, I'm personally not aware of any restrictions,'' Wilhelm said.
