LOS ANGELES _ The monster lizard again failed to deliver monster ticket sales as the second weekend of ``Godzilla'' took in an estimated $18 million at 3,310 theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
The total gave Sony's much-hyped extravaganza $99.3million after 13 days _ an impressive total for most films but a disappointment for one featuring the largest promotional campaign ever with promises that ``Godzilla'' would become a must-see blockbuster.
Business for ``Godzilla'' had been expected to fall quickly but its 59 percent decline from its opening Friday-Sunday was significantly steeper than last year's 53 percent fall for ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' during the same weekend.
Steven Spielberg's dino-sequel eventually took in $229 million domestically while ``Godzilla's'' final U.S. gross is likely to come in around $150 million, half what many forecasters expected before the opening.
``The `Godzilla' results are very soft for the second weekend and it looks like there's no repeat business,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica.
``Many people who saw it are disappointed because it doesn't deliver the goods.''
Rockwell, a former studio executive, said Sony may have erred by pushing ``Godzilla'' too aggressively.
``What they needed was to create a campaign that made you want to see the film, not one with the message that you must see it,'' he said.
Overall business was ahead of the same weekend last year as rival releases posted relatively strong numbers, led by 20th Century Fox's opening of Sandra Bullock's ``Hope Floats'' with $14.7 million at 2,367 theaters.
