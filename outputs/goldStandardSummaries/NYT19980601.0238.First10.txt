SAN FRANCISCO _ A recent British study found that an increasing number of elderly people were mixed up, frightened, often belligerently defensive and sometimes happily oblivious because television had taken over their minds, at least temporarily.
According to a London Observer story on the study: ``The evidence is alarming.
It includes one 90-year-old woman who remembered the themes of television programs but forgot the identities of the main characters.
To compensate, she transposed their identities on to people she knew well, leading to bitter accusations against her family.
``Among these were claims that her grandson was being led astray by prostitutes; that her son-in-law, a retired doctor, was facing charges of assault for beating a man in the same room as her and that her doctor was a transvestite.
She also accused a ward sister of being a stripper.''
Remember, this is in a country not heavily tuned in to Jerry Springer's universe.
Anyone who has ever dealt with a parent or loved one suffering through Alzheimer's disease, or related ailments, understands it's one of life's grayest emotional areas.
On the one hand, a thinking, loving person is slipping away, forgetting family members like fading pictures.
