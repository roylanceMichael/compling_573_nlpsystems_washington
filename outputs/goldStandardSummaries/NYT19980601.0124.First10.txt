The ruins of crony banks and businesses built on corruption and special favors litter the devastated economies of Southeast Asia, making it easy to notice what the region's leaders did wrong.
But buried under the rubble are a number of things that these societies did right _ steps they took, or societal strengths they preserved, that may soften the trauma of the economic crisis they are going through.
These are characteristics largely unmatched by Latin American, African and South Asian nations like India and Pakistan.
And they may well serve as a cushion on which the societies of Southeast Asia can bounce back once the economic panic recedes.
Jean-Michel Severino, the World Bank's vice president for East Asia and the Pacific, cites three major achievements.
The most obvious is ``the good macroeconomic management that prevailed in the region for 20, 30 years _ tight monetary policy, no fiscal deficits, a kind of caution in the way public affairs were run,'' he said.
``Unlike the Latin American countries, this will be the cushion that will allow them to absorb better the costs of financial restructuring.''
Second was the ``outward looking'' character of many of the region's economies, which took to the export trade with alacrity.
Even though trade within Asia has crashed for now, they do not need to learn how to live in a global market.
