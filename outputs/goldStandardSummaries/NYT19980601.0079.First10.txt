ATLANTA _ It's not so much trouble to reach for the stack of compact discs, pick the one you suddenly have a hankering for, pop it into the CD player and hit play.
But wouldn't it be nice to just tap the CD player and have that tune start playing?
You can, if you have every single CD you own sitting in the CD player.
And you can have that if you have the cash to buy one of the new Kenwood 200-disc CD mega-changers.
One of the key advantages CD technology has over tapes and records is random access _ the ability to play the track you want without first listening to a bunch of other stuff.
The new Kenwood line means to take that idea one step further by making the CD player your storage unit as well.
What if you have in mind a musical feeling, but you really don't want to spend a long time picking out individual tunes?
Each of the new Kenwoods includes a memory function that lets users fill in data about each disc, designating one of 26 pre-programmed categories (rock, jazz, classical, etc.).
Then if you wake up Sunday morning and want to hear Sam and Dave, Aretha, Otis or the Temptations, you just let the machine ``shuffle'' through the Motown genre.
