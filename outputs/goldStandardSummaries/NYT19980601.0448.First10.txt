NEW YORK _ The amendment was brief, so it attracted scant notice when Sen. Alfonse D'Amato helped tuck it into a bill he was shepherding through the Senate as chairman of the Banking Committee.
But the provision, which weakened a consumer protection statute governing mortgages, was decidedly important to one company.
D'Amato agreed to support the provision in late 1995 after lobbying by MBNA Corp., one of the nation's biggest issuers of credit cards.
MBNA is also one of the senator's biggest benefactors, having channeled more than $500,000 in recent years to campaign committees that he leads.
Throughout his career, D'Amato has been a tireless fund-raiser, a politician who works the phones with a barker's gusto.
But since taking over the Banking Committee in 1995, he has made his previous fund-raising seem almost pedestrian, harvesting millions of dollars from individuals and companies in the financial industry that, like MBNA, have a stake in legislation that as chairman he can control with a penstroke.
The money has not only filled D'Amato's Senate campaign account.
It has also enriched the New York Republican State Committee, strengthening the senator's formidable political network and reinforcing his status as the state's dominant Republican.
There is nothing unusual or illegal about members of Congress reeling in contributions from interests they oversee.
