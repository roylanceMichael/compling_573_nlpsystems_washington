NEW YORK _ If there is any act more vicious than the hoax perpetrated against Robert, the tormented hero of Craig Lucas' tortured new play, ``The Dying Gaul,'' it might be labeled a psychic atrocity.
Robert, played by Tim Hopper, still deep in mourning over his dead lover Malcolm, takes up with Jeffrey (Tony Goldwyn), a bisexual Hollywood producer married to Elaine (Linda Emond), who is aware of Jeffrey's infidelity and is desperate to understand the nature of his passion.
With her trusty laptop, she enters the world of Internet chat rooms posing as a gay man and, wouldn't you know it, there she encounters the same Robert, a fellow seeker of online liaisons.
What follows is unregenerate cruelty: In her male guise (and having, by virtue of another unlikely complication, broken into the office of Robert's psychiatrist and memorized his notes), Elaine convinces Robert that she is the dead Malcolm, floating around in his computer software.
Do you believe in cyberghosts?
Lucas, who in ``Prelude to a Kiss'' displayed a lyrical gift for stories blending romance and the occult, walks a decidedly darker path in ``The Dying Gaul,'' a minor tantrum of a play about the kind of black grief that can mutate into bottomless rage.
Still, this plot-driven drama at the Vineyard Theater does at times achieve a disquieting creepiness, thanks to the surehanded direction of Mark Brokaw and a first-rate cast, led by Ms. Emond and Hopper, that manages to sustain the dramatic tension, even when compassion for these harsh characters is too much to expect.
``Prelude to a Kiss'' took flight on the out-of-body energy unleashed in the meeting of two pairs of lips; Lucas held you with the pure poetry of wish fulfillment.
``The Dying Gaul'' is the somber epilogue to a love foreshortened by death.
