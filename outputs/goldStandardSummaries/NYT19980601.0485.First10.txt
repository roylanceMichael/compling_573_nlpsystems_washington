BELGRADE, Serbia _ President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has started a sweeping campaign to wipe out a separatist rebel movement in the Serbian province in Kosovo, senior NATO officials and Western diplomats say.
The campaign involves several thousand heavily armed special police officers and soldiers backed by artillery batteries.
It has escalated swiftly over the last three days and seems set to extinguish the faint hope of a negotiated settlement between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian population.
If the conflict spilled across the border, as many now fear, it could draw the region into a war.
Neighboring Albania is sympathetic to the separatist struggle in Kosovo, as is a restive ethnic Albanian minority in Macedonia.
``NATO is watching the evolving situation in Kosovo with increasing concern as the conflict there has intensified,'' said Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe, in an interview at NATO headquarters in Belgium on Friday.
He added: ``There are increasing reports of the use of artillery and heavy weapons by the Serbs.
We have heard reports of these weapons being used along the border and in other places.''
The Albanian government said Monday that about 1,000 ethnic Albanians, some wounded, had fled into Albania from Kosovo since Sunday.
