NEW YORK _ By the usual definition, scoring 11 runs in the third inning, the biggest inning against the Yankees in 55 years, and winning by six constitutes a laugher.
Then why wasn't anyone wearing a Red Sox uniform laughing Sunday afternoon?
Because before the end of a 13-7 win over the New York Yankees, slugger Mo Vaughn was mad at his teammates, pitcher Pedro Martinez was mad at plate umpire Jim Joyce and Yankee outfielder Bernie Williams, and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan was mad at the American League.
Dennis Eckersley, meanwhile, was too drained to express either mirth or anger.
The Eck was just relieved to have survived the seventh inning, when the Yankees drew to within 11-7, loaded the bases, and had the tying run at the plate with no outs.
That's right, no outs.
``Think about them coming back from 11-0,'' Eckersley said.
``That would have been humiliating.
That would have been the ultimate.
