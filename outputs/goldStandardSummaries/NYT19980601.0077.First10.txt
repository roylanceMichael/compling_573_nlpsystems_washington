ATLANTA _ A report last week from an educational trade association suggests that Americans have a wildly inflated view of the cost of college tuition.
But a second look shows that we actually have a reasonable idea of the total cost _ not just tuition _ of a year in college.
The American Council on Education's study says that tuition at four-year public colleges averages $3,111.
In a telephone poll, respondents guessed an average of $9,694.
That guess is not far off from the total cost, including tuition, books, room and board, transportation and other expenses.
According to the College Board, that total is $10,069.
The council's study did illuminate American attitudes toward college and their kids.
The majority believe college is worth the price and it is a top concern for their own children.
Most families think they can afford to pay for college.
