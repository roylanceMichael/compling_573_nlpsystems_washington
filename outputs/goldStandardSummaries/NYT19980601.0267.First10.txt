HEART-OBESITY-MED _ NEW YORK _ Obesity has graduated from a contributing risk factor for heart disease to a major one, experts from the American Heart Association are scheduled to announce here Monday.
But congratulations are not in order, as the promotion now places obesity in the same class with other preventable heart-disease risk factors such as smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and sedentary lifestyle, according to Dr. Robert H. Eckel, vice-chairman of the American Heart Association's (AHA) volunteer nutrition committee and a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.
Formerly, obesity was considered a contributing factor to heart disease, but recent evidence has shown that it is, in fact, a major risk factor, Eckel said at an AHA-sponsored media briefing.
But modest weight loss of 5 percent to 10 percent of body weight can reduce blood pressure levels and high cholesterol, he said.
Eckel called for more research into the causes of obesity and suggested a need ``to develop better treatment and lifestyle strategies to address the issue of obesity without passing moral judgment.''
