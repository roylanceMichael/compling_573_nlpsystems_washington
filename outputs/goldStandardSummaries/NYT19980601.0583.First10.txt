It's the sweet smell of six-cess.
The Bulls and Michael Jordan will be gunning for their sixth NBA championship in the '90s when they take on the Jazz in the championship series starting Wednesday night at the Delta Center, a rematch of last year's NBA Finals won by Chicago in six games.
That's not much time for the Bulls to recover from their physically demanding battle in the Eastern Conference finals, in which they edged Indiana 88-83 in Game 7 on Sunday at the United Center.
Utah, meanwhile, has been sitting around since eliminating the Los Angeles Lakers on May 24.
``Chicago has an excellent chance of going out there and stealing one of the first two games,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird.
``Utah has been lying around for 10 days.
I was in that situation one time.
I think we had eight days off, and there's no way you can stay in game shape by sitting around.
So Chicago has a great opportunity to go out there and get one early.''
