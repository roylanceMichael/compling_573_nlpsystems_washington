PARIS _ Giddy as a man who had just won the lottery, or at the very least won his first career Grand Slam event at the doddering age of 28, Cedric Pioline kissed his racquet, his wristband, and almost kissed Moscow's Marat Safin, the towering neophyte he had outwitted and outlasted in a five-set test Monday.
With 15,000 fans in delirium and the 18-year-old Safin in a tailspin, Pioline completed his mission, which was to fight his way into his second quarterfinal here after a decade spent trying to distinguish himself on his native clay at Roland Garros.
Covering the court like a madman, and returning Safin's thundering serve as if he had been programmed to decipher it, Pioline prevailed 7-5, 4-6, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-4 and remained the last hope of France at this French Open.
The 3:18 struggle turned into a triumph of experience over raw ambition: Pioline, father of two and veteran of 31 Grand Slam events, including two finals, remained focused from beginning to end.
``Experience got me through, and the people,'' said Pioline, who admitted his ``legs and mind'' were just about gone by the time the 6-foot-4-inch Safin shanked a backhand return on the Frenchman's second match point.
Safin, appearing in his first Grand Slam event after making his Davis Cup debut alongside Yevgeny Kafelnikov two months ago in a losing effort in Atlanta, lost his concentration in the fourth set and couldn't retrieve it.
``No concentration on important points,'' said Safin, who left Russia when he was 14 to train year-round in Spain, sponsored by a Swiss bank he never bothered to learn the name of.
``They just send the money,'' said Safin, who is now bankrolling himself.
He earned more here in a week than he did in all of 1997, and planned to tackle Wimbledon next.
