KANSAS CITY, MO.
_ One of the sarcastic young ciphers on ``SportsCenter'' cracked the other night: ``Convicted felons should be forced to watch the Royals and the A's.''
Which raises the obvious question: Did someone send ESPN an advance tape of the Royals' 10-4 win over the A's Sunday at Kauffman Stadium?
The A's bullpen fell apart again, this time taking the brunt of an eight-hit, seven-run outburst in the seventh inning that turned a perfectly tidy game into something more like a toxic waste dump.
Since last Sunday, the A's bullpen has a hideous 7.80 ERA and that doesn't begin to convey the horror.
``I don't think anybody is getting down,'' left-hander Buddy Groom insisted.
``We showed earlier in the month we can put some scoreless innings together.
So I don't think there's any reason to panic.''
Sure thing, Buddy.
