GEORGE, South Africa _ Over and over Monday, the prosecution in the contempt trial of former President P.W.
Botha used its first witness to lay out the questions that remain unanswered.
What exactly did the man who governed South Africa during its most brutal period of repression mean when he approved, as documents indicate, the elimination, neutralization and permanent removal from society of anti-apartheid activists?
If he did not mean murder and torture, was anything done to make sure that there was no misunderstanding?
When, as one witness has testified, concern was raised that such behavior had become widespread, was any action taken?
And what about the witnesses who have said that they bombed a church building or crossed South Africa's borders to murder political opponents under direct orders from him?
As the trial of Botha continued Monday after a six-week recess, the prosecution tried to make clear that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigating atrocities of the past had good reason to want answers from the 82-year-old former president, who is facing charges of contempt for refusing to appear before the panel.
If convicted, he faces a jail sentence of up to two years and a fine.
The sometimes frail-looking Botha, sitting in a specially padded seat because of hip replacement surgery, has remained defiant, calling the Truth Commission a circus and a witch hunt.
