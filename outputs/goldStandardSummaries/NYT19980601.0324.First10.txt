Because weight loss ultimately relies on using more calories than you consume, and because protein sources are high in calories, weight loss requires consuming smaller amounts.
Carbohydrates have long been the mainstay of most weight-loss diets for exactly the opposite reason: They are relatively low in calories and high in bulk.
Calorie for calorie, you can eat more of them and feel more full.
But the Sugar Busters diet does not allow potatoes or anything made from white rice or white flour, including bread, bagels and pasta.
An added risk, ironically, is that the high-protein/low carbohydrate diet will work too well.
Restricting carbohydrates can cause the body to start breaking down some of the fat stored in cells, but that breakdown can result in ketosis, a nutritional disease that causes bad breath as well as diarrhea, headaches, weakness, low blood pressure, fatigue and sleeplessness, according to Anderson.
``The most serious side effect is that, if kept up over a long time, these diets can cause kidney and liver damage,'' she said.
Ultimately, you might be busting more than sugar.
