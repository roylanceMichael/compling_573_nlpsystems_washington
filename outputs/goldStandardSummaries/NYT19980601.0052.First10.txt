WASHINGTON _ Democrats hope to breathe new life this week into the moribund nomination of San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg, embarking on a strategy that could elevate a low-level diplomatic appointment into a battleground over gay rights.
Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal Democrat from Minnesota, is threatening to attach an amendment calling for Hormel's confirmation to any bill that reaches the Senate floor.
And the White House is looking for an appropriate forum for President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to push for the Senate to act.
The White House recently made a high-profile push for another embattled nominee _ Bill Lann Lee, the administration's choice as the Department of Justice's civil rights chief _ and is preparing to do the same with Hormel.
``The president, the vice president, and the secretary of state continue to take every opportunity to push the leadership of the Senate,'' said Clinton aide Richard Socarides.
``They will start to do that more publicly when the Senate comes back'' from its recess this week.
Hormel is the nation's first openly gay nominee for an ambassadorship, a post that requires Senate confirmation.
Although he appears to have the support of a majority of senators, a handful of Republicans have voiced objections to Hormel's long-standing support for gay causes and used a procedural maneuver to prevent the full Senate from voting.
The clash could quickly grow into a high-profile showdown over gay rights, reminiscent of former San Francisco Supervisor Roberta Achtenberg's fight to win confirmation for a high-ranking post at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
