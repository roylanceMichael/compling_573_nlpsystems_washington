Fifty years ago Wednesday some 800 astronomers and VIPs gathered under the new Hale Telescope on the summit of Palomar Mountain, near San Diego, to celebrate the telescope's ``first light,'' as astronomers call the moment when a new telescope is opened to the night sky for the first time.
The Hale Telescope, named for George Ellery Hale, who proposed it in 1928, was the largest and greatest working telescope on earth.
For more than a generation, the world's leading astronomers used the Hale to make fundamental discoveries that changed our views of the universe.
Allan Sandage spent 20 years using the Hale to explore the size and age of the universe, a project that seems to have a grandeur beyond almost any other quest in science.
In 1963, Maarten Schmidt was using the Hale to examine quasars when he discovered that quasars are not the nearby stars astronomers had assumed them to be, but powerful, brilliant objects in the distant reaches of the universe, a discovery that revealed that the universe contains objects of almost incredible energy.
(Quasars are now believed to be supermassive black holes swallowing matter at the centers of distant galaxies.)
The telescope was originally operated jointly by the Mount Wilson Observatory and the California Institute of Technology, but after years of feuding over the management of the telescope, the two institutions divorced in the 1980s, leaving Caltech in charge on Palomar.
The Hale was probably the most famous scientific instrument in history even before starlight had graced its mirror, and it seemed to symbolize the 20th century's greatest hopes.
George Ellery Hale, a solar physicist, had a vivid imagination and a talent for fund-raising.
