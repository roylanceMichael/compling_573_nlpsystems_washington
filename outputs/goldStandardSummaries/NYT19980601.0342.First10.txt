SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The 1998 primary campaign for California governor has shown more clearly than ever that two things are inevitable in America: excess and television.
These forces came together during the past eight months to produce a political campaign existing almost entirely within a wallpaper of television advertising and fold-out brochures.
Two millionaires opened their wallets and helped make this the most expensive state campaign in history _ $55 million and rising.
Even the poorest candidate, Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis, neared a record in spending.
As Davis said this week: ``In California politics, if you're not on TV, you don't exist.''
This astonishing display of money and media aloofness came in the middle of a radical change in California politics.
Tuesday's primary allows all voters to vote for any candidate, regardless of party.
The 1998 primary campaign has left even the most battle-worn political consultants shaking their heads in astonishment.
