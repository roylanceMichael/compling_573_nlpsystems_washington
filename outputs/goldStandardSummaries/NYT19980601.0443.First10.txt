WASHINGTON _ House Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner is using his dispute with Rep. Jim McDermott as a fund-raising tool, urging potential campaign contributors to send money to ``help me bring the Democrats to justice.''
Boehner is using his campaign treasury to pay for a lawsuit against McDermott, who he believes provided newspaper reporters with a tape of an illegally recorded phone conversation between Boehner, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other top House Republicans.
``Americans are fed up with self-righteous liberals who think eavesdropping, illegally taping private conversations, and leaking privileged information are OK as long as it's the Democrats who are doing it,'' Boehner wrote.
In the fund-raising appeal, Boehner also appeared to threaten Attorney General Janet Reno, who he says has ``hemmed and hawed, stewed and stalled, diddled and delayed'' instead of bringing charges against McDermott.
``I've grown weary of her foot-dragging and his legal tactics to hide the truth,'' Boehner wrote.
``It's time for Janet Reno to do her job or face the consequences.''
Boehner, R-Ohio, did not specify in the letter what consequences Reno should face for declining to prosecute McDermott, D-Wash, although at one point he wrote ``if Janet Reno won't do her job, she shouldn't have her job.''
Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg said Monday ``the investigation (of McDermott) is ongoing and active.
I'm not in a position to be any more specific.''
