NEW YORK _ The Yankees, the team with the best record in baseball and, therefore, the fewest problems, don't often have to sweat the details.
But lose two games in a row and even the Yankees encounter some turbulence.
So it was Monday night when even baseball's best were beset with niggling little questions.
Could Ramiro Mendoza stop creeping concerns about a couple of the Yankees starters, including himself?
Could Tino Martinez shake the 0-for-12 slump he had found since coming back from the injurious hit laid on him by an Armando Benitez fastball?
Finally, could the team recover after watching not only Mike Stanton but Mariano Rivera blow saves after the Yankees had come within six outs of beating the visiting White Sox Monday night?
The answer proved to be a resounding yes to all the questions, because Tim Raines and Chad Curtis _ two Yankees seemingly always above question _ combined a two-out walk and a double into the left-field corner to bring the Yankees a 5-4 victory in 10 innings.
Raines scored all the way from first as Curtis ended a night in which he had also homered by delivering the winning hit against Chicago reliever Matt Karchner.
One day after the Yankees had lost a second straight game for only the third time this season, there was little introspection among the members of the winningest team in the major leagues.
