BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The pressure is off of the Buffalo Sabres now.
There is no one outside of the Sabres' locker room, not even the fans in Buffalo, according to coach Lindy Ruff, who expect the Sabres to come back against the Washington Capitals in the Eastern Conference finals.
And as if a huge weight had been lifted from their collective shoulders, the mood at Sunday's practice was light, despite a discouraging 2-0 loss to the Capitals on Saturday night at Marine Midland Arena, a loss which put the Sabres down 3-1, a game away from elimination from the NHL playoffs.
Instead of moping, casting their heads downward, or showing any of the telltale signs of surrender, the players filled Midland Arena with boisterous laughter as they skated through an easy workout, concentrating mostly on correcting the team's struggling power play.
The Sabres went 0- for- 7 with the man-advantage on Saturday.
Even Dominik Hasek, the Sabres goalie, who allowed a 70-footer into his goal on Saturday and subsequently took the brunt of the blame for the loss, was wearing a smile Sunday.
He was also wearing a sign made of tape on the front of his helmet.
It said, ``Sorrento,'' which is the name of a local cheese company.
Wait, there was more.
