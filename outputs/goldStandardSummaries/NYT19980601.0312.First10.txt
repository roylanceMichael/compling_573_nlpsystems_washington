Pedro Lopez left his Bronx home in a big hurry one morning several months ago and became a medical statistic by nightfall.
Nothing happened to him; he felt fine.
But the vials of prescription medications on the edge of his bathroom sink went unopened that morning, and again that afternoon, and then most of the rest of the week.
By the end of the month he had stopped taking them at all.
With other things on his mind, Lopez, 41 and disabled, had joined the ranks of millions of Americans who fail to take their medications as prescribed _ and who are suddenly attracting a flood of attention in the health-care world.
Study after study over the last 20 years has shown that misuse of prescription drugs is a worldwide epidemic every bit as dangerous and costly as an actual medical illness.
It was tagged ``America's other drug problem'' in the early 1990s when researchers consistently found it responsible for 10 to 25 percent of hospital and nursing home admissions studied.
In 1984, the National Pharmaceutical Council, an association of pharmaceutical companies, estimated that misuse of prescription drugs had caused 125,000 deaths a year from heart disease alone.
In 1993 the same organization calculated that not taking medicines correctly was draining upwards of $100 billion a year from the nation's economy in direct and indirect costs.
