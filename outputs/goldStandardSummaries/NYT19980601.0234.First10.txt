ALBANY, N.Y. _ About 75 percent of U.S. households have a barbecue grill, according to the Barbecue Industry Association.
With convenient cart-type covered grills, more than half of Americans now cook outside year-round.
The Northeast leads the heavy-barbecuer category, which means barbecuing four or more times a month.
Gas grills are widely used now.
Charcoal briquettes, which were invented after World War II by automotive entrepreneur Henry Ford, are a matter of preference.
(Ford took wood left over from making cars and ground and pressed it into briquettes, which were often sold at car dealers, so early motorists could stop and cook lunch along the road.)
Today there are a number of instant-light or light-the-bag products for those who prefer cooking over charcoal.
Natural lump charcoal costs a bit more than charcoal briquettes, but it burns hotter, requires fewer lumps and partially burned natural lump charcoal can be reused.
Briquettes work better for long cooking periods, because they produce more consistent heat.
