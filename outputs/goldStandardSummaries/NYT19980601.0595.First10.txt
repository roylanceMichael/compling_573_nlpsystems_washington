PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ The New York Mets outfielder who denied to police he was too drunk to drive in March, pleaded no contest Monday to a misdemeanor charge of driving under the influence.
St. Lucie County Judge Dan Vaughn sentenced Bernard Gilkey, 31, to a year of probation and 50 hours of community service.
His license was suspended for six months and he must attend DUI classes and pay $250 plus court costs.
Gilkey was not in court when his attorney, Richard Kibbey, entered the plea.
Kibbey said his client decided to plea no contest to the charges because there was no videotape of his arrest, meaning the case would boil down to his word against that of the two police officers.
He also didn't want to interrupt his ball playing for a trial.
``He's having a phenomenal season right now,'' Kibbey said.
``He wants to focus his energies towards what he does best.''
Addressing reporters soon after his arrest, Gilkey said he'd had ``a couple of beers'' on his way home but denied his driving was impaired.
