He was a young, bookish, bespectacled version of Che Guevara, a young revolutionary whose only romantic touch was the red-and-black silk Sandinista bandanna around his neck.
The Sixties' style high-heel boots were not a fashion statement, but simply to lift him up to something like average height.
But Daniel Ortega captured the hearts of the post-Guevara generation when he led the ragtag men and women of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) into Managua in July 1979 after overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza in a guerrilla war that had soaked Nicaraguan streets in blood.
As ``coordinator'' of the revolution, a man who had spent seven years in Somoza's jails, often tortured, no one batted an eyelid when the Sandinistas appointed him President of Nicaragua, a post he held until world pressure forced him to hold free elections in 1990.
As Sandinista leader, Ortega became the new symbol of revolution 20 years after Guevara and Fidel Castro had overthrown Cuba's dictator, Fulgencio Batista.
With Guevara long dead _ killed in Bolivia in 1967 _ and Castro deeply frozen inside the Cold War, Ortega became the biggest thorn in the side of the United States, and the focal point of Ronald Reagan's anti-communist paranoia.
His confiscation of property and land, including that of American owners, did not add to his popularity in the U.S.    Reagan called him a ``tin-pot dictator.''
His successor George Bush called him ``a skunk at a garden party.''
Genuinely fearing that the Sandinistas would spread their revolution north, up through Central America and Mexico, Reagan ordered Border Patrol guards in such cities as Brownsville, Texas, to be on extra alert.
