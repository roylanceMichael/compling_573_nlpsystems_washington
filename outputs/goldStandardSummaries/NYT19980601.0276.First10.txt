WASHINGTON _ Among a planeload of passengers there is almost always a doctor, nurse or medical technician, but when an airliner is at cruise altitude, the nearest equipment to diagnose or treat a heart attack is usually seven miles below.
&QL;    Now, however, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Alaska Airlines are equipping their planes with a machine that is a combination heart monitor and defibrillator _ that is, a device that produces an EKG, and one that shocks the heart back into normal rhythm if necessary.
The device is already credited with saving one passenger's life, on a flight from Dallas to Mexico City on Feb. 18, and has helped many other times to determine whether a stricken passenger was, in fact, having a heart attack.
&QL;    In equipping their planes, the airlines are following the lead set by Qantas, which flies mostly long over-water flights where there is no place to land in an emergency.
But the United States carriers are planning the equipment for their domestic flights, too.
&QL;    As the big airlines adopt the policy, Congress has directed the Federal Aviation Administration to study whether all airlines should be required to carry more medical equipment.
&QL;    Medical emergency may not be the first risk that leaps to a traveler's mind when boarding an airplane, but in some years heart attacks in the sky are more frequent than deaths or injuries in crashes.
The FAA does not keep statistics, but the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the big airlines, asked its members to keep track during 1996, and it counted 141 heart attacks and 433 cases of passengers complaining of chest pain.
Among the 578 million passengers that year, there were 10,500 medical incidents _ one for each 55,000 passengers, or one for each 780 flights.
