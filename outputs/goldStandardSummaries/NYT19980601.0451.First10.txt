MOSCOW _ Despite President Clinton's effort to bring about an end to Russia's financial crisis, the outlook continued to darken Monday.
The Russian stock market fell by more than 10 percent, and there were signs of strain among banks and in Russia's young futures market.
The major test, however, will come on Wednesday when the government tries to sell eight billion rubles worth of treasury bills.
Analysts fear that the government will find it difficult to find buyers, further unnerving legions of jittery investors.
This is not what Washington had hoped for when Clinton said on Sunday that the United States was ready to support additional financial aid to Russia.
The International Monetary Fund said on Friday that it expected to disburse $670 million in assistance this month.
And the statement by Clinton was intended to underscore American support for an international effort that would go well beyond that, if needed.
Clinton's statement contained no figures or details about how and when the additional assistance might be organized.
But the theory was the Clinton administration could could soothe investors simply by publicizing Washington's willingness to help.
