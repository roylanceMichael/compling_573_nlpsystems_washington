It is 30 years now, and yet with each passing year, 1968 _ the annus horribilis of the American Century _ seems ever more horrible, its strife ever more unsettling, its losses ever more unbearable, its meaning ever more portentous.
And though we now sit smugly at the hinge of a new century, the stock market at giddy heights, the Cold War transformed from menace to memory, we are haunted, still, by 1968.
The tell-tale heart of that year may have been buried beneath the floorboards 30 years ago, but if we listen carefully to the rhythms of life in America we can still hear it beating.
This is its sound: The Tet offensive.
The student and antiwar rebellions.
The Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. cut down in Memphis.
Violence at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
The election of Richard Milhous Nixon.
