WASHINGTON _ The Boeing Co., now the nation's second largest defense contractor, has vaulted into first place in a defense industry category that really matters in Washington, D.C.: campaign contributions.
Figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics show that Boeing has given more than $1 million to federal campaigns over the past 17 months, more than any other defense contractor.
The contributions come at a time when a vastly expanded Boeing _ the company now employs 237,500 people _ faces a myriad of concerns in Congress, ranging from defense spending to international trade policy.
Just Monday, Boeing bought three full-page, color ads in Roll Call, a newspaper widely read in D.C. political circles.
One promoted its role as prime contractor of the international space station, another touted the alleged successes of acquisition reform at the Pentagon, and a centerfold pushed the F-22 fighter jet as ``bad news for bullies everywhere.''
Wednesday Boeing will join the annual battle to promote normal trade relations with China _ a country that remains a huge potential market for commercial aircraft, but that is enmeshed in bitter controversy in Congress.
The annual June debate, always contentious, is complicated this year by controversies over satellite launches, campaign contributions and rising nuclear tension in Asia.
President Clinton will make a strong case for renewing trade ties with China, his spokesman said.
The increasing campaign spending by Boeing brings increasing scrutiny for the Seattle-based company.
