DETROIT _ The Stars decided to take an aggressive game to the Joe Louis Arena ice last night and make the Detroit Red Wings react.
The Wings did, to the tune of four goals on the first 11 shots while riding to a 5-3 victory in Game 3 of what was supposed to be a defensive-minded Western Conference finals.
The victory gives the Red Wings a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series heading into tomorrow's 1 p.m. rematch at Joe Louis Arena _ a place in which the Stars are 1-15-2 in their past 18 games.
It also could have the Stars in a sort of identity crisis.
While the team has pitched strong defensive play throughout the playoffs, they decided to gamble yesterday and force the issue.
While that resulted in numerous offensive chances and a 34-20 edge in shots, it also allowed the Red Wings to sneak through the little cracks.
``I think we can play aggressively, we just can't make the mistakes we made,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said.
``We made a few mistakes and they took advantage.''
After the Stars closed to within 4-3 in the third period, a Detroit goal with 4:05 remaining ended comeback hopes.
