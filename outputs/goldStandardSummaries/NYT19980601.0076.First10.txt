ATLANTA _ Score one for the technicians.
These are the stock market wizards who practice technical analysis, an approach based on the idea that supply and demand explain the price movements of a stock or the entire market.
Technicians look at factors that can be quantified, such as volume, the number of new highs and new lows, price-to-earnings ratios, 200-day moving averages and a host of others.
Dan Sullivan, who writes one of the better Wall Street market letters, had this astonishing sentence in a recent edition of The Chartist newsletter: ``It's not important to know what business (a) company is in.''
In fact, he suggested, it might be better not to know, since an investor might get emotionally involved with the company and do something stupid.
The other school of thought is fundamental analysis.
It looks at the relationship between investment markets and such factors as management changes at a company, new products, economic growth rates, inflation and political events.
The idea is political, social and other events influence the way people behave, and one form of behavior is investing in stocks _ or bonds, or real estate or art.
Fundamentalists have been saying for some time that dismal profit growth this year would cause people to pull back from the market: Those in the market would sell some of their holdings to raise cash; those not in it would park their money in cash or bonds until the right moment arrives for stocks.
