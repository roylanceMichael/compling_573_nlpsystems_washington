GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Schoolteaching is not necessarily a conduit to the world of metaphysics, but my colleagues and I have had a revelation.
Vice President Gore is full of baloney.
Hooking kids up to the Internet is not the universal remedy for what ails education.
Mr. Gore is, of course, sincere in his belief that high-tech communications and information systems are going to ``fix what's broke'' in our schools.
Sincere, but misguided.
Pudgy little hands manipulating mice (mouses?
meeses?)
are impressive, but not indicative that the brain attached to the hand is learning anything more than how to surf for cartoons or vaporize space marauders.
When I was five, my father spread out a schematic on the dining room table and taught me how a Pullman car's cooling system worked.
