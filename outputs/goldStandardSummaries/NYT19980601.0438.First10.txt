WASHINGTON _ The dispute over executive privilege now embroiling President Clinton resonates with great legal and historical principles, pitting the sanctity of presidential communications against the majesty of the law.
But this clash of forces also boils down to more mundane matters _ the political calendar and the loyalty of Bruce Lindsey, the closed-mouthed guardian of the president's most intimate secrets.
With its carefully-calibrated legal response Monday, the White House continued a strategy it has pursued throughout the serpentine Whitewater investigation: Challenge Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel directing the inquiry, at every turn and delay the completion of the investigation in hopes the public will lose interest over time.
This approach avoids a high-profile confrontation before the Supreme Court, with all the obvious reminders of the battle that finally doomed the presidency of Richard Nixon.
It gives the appearance of cooperation and compromise while slowing Starr's inquiry and moving the case off the front pages.
If Starr is stymied in the courts, this reasoning goes, he will be forced to play out his hand in his report to the House of Representatives, a political forum where Clinton has numerous allies and where talk of impeachment over what the public sees as largely personal matters sends shivers down even Republican spines.
But Charles F.C.
Ruff, the White House counsel, said at a briefing for reporters that Monday's legal filing was about constitutional imperatives and presidential prerogatives _ and nothing more.
``There will undoubtedly be folks out there and in this room who suggest that this is part of a great scheme to delay,'' Ruff said.
