Political carnivorousness remains unabated, partisan appetites never satiated.
Hypocrisy _ a technical-sounding term for the droppings of a male cow _ is the main ingredient of much of it.
Two great recent examples are the incongruous rantings of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as he spews his double-speak bile about the Middle East _ a breach of U.S. political ethics _ and last weekend's so-called response to President Clinton's Saturday radio address.
In the latter, Sen.
Kit Bond (R-Mo.)
used his time to assault the Clinton administration for turning ``a blind eye to the evils of illegal drugs.''
That this was a ``response'' and that Clinton's Saturday talk had nothing to do with illegal drugs and everything to do with prayer in the schools only documents that these responses are not responses at all but planned political strikes.
Bond's script was not unique to Republicans; Democrats employed the same tactics during the years of Reagan-Bush.
If the opposition party cannot respond meaningfully to what the president is talking about, then it ought not respond at all.
