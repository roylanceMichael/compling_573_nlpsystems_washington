COLUMBUS, Ohio _ In 1995, Patty Branham was told her colon cancer had spread to her liver.
Her doctors said the only treatment that would keep her alive was a surgery that would destroy tumors by freezing them.
But the 35-year-old woman never got the operation.
Branham's managed-care health plan, CIGNA HealthCare of Ohio, refused to pay for the surgery, saying it was too ``experimental and investigational.''
It took CIGNA a month to reach that decision and another month to review Branham's appeal, which CIGNA rejected, even though its experts said the surgery was an accepted medical technique.
Branham's tumors, meanwhile, doubled in size.
And four months after her initial request for coverage _ while still battling the insurance company _ she died.
Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Branham's husband, Craig, has the right to sue CIGNA because a company clause requiring arbitation for disagreements was vague and therefore non-binding.
Justice Paul Pfeifer, who wrote the court's majority opinion, said her ordeal is the very scenario that frightens so many Americans, who worry about whether their coverage will be enough to see them through a time of real trouble.
