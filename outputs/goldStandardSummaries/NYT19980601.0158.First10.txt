In the months after Christopher Reeve suffered a riding accident that paralyzed him from the neck down, he sought escape in sleep.
In his dreams he would be whole again and able to resume his active life.
Then he would wake up in his hospital room, stare at a screen that monitored his vital signs and wonder why he was still alive.
With the love of his wife, friends and family, his attitude gradually changed.
He stopped wondering, ``What life do I have?''
and began to consider, ``What life can I build?''
In ``Still Me'' (Random House, $25), Reeve writes movingly about his accident, which occurred three years ago, and its aftermath.
It is an optimistic yet realistic account that avoids the cloying, everyone-lives-happily-ever-after quality of such stories.
From an early age, Reeve writes, he was someone who enjoyed being in control.
