On the morning of Jan. 21, 1989, Billy Tipton, 74, a gifted jazz musician who was a veteran of the tiny clubs and VFW posts of small-town America, collapsed on the floor of a mobile home in Spokane, Wash. Tipton's son William summoned paramedics, and as they opened Tipton's pajamas to perform resuscitation, they made an extraordinary discovery.
Tipton, who most people had assumed to be a man, who had had at least five wives and had adopted three sons, was in fact a woman.
``Did your father ever have a sex change?''
the paramedics asked William, he later recalled.
The news that Tipton, a pianist and saxophonist, was a woman came as a shock to nearly everyone, including the women who had considered themselves his wives, as well as his sons and the musicians who had traveled with him.
And the story has intrigued writers and composers ever since.
The figure of Billy Tipton has become an emblem for the current fascination with gender, manifest in films like ``The Crying Game,'' the play ``M. Butterfly,'' and in the burgeoning academic field of ``queer theory,'' which is entirely devoted to the subject of sexual identity.
Tipton's life has inspired an opera, ``Billy,'' with music by Timothy Brock and a libretto by Brian Willis; a play, ``Stevie Wants to Play the Blues,'' by Eduardo Machado, and a jazz musical, ``The Slow Drag,'' by Carson Kreitzer, which was performed off-Broadway in 1996.
It was also featured in a theatrical revue, ``The Opposite Sex Is Neither,'' by Kate Bornstein, a woman who used to be a man.
