NEW YORK _ As refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia began trickling into the Bronx about 15 years ago, their minds and bodies scarred by war, Montefiore Medical Center, a private hospital with a long history of serving immigrant and indigent New Yorkers, established a clinic to serve them.
The federally subsidized clinic in East Fordham employed full-time interpreters speaking Vietnamese and Khmer, the Cambodian language.
The interpreters scheduled the refugees' appointments, helped them communicate with doctors and stood by them through Pap smears, X-rays, MRIs and other unfamiliar rituals of Western medicine.
But in April, because of financial pressures, the hospital reassigned its two full-time interpreters to clerical jobs.
It now relies on eight employees fluent in Khmer or Vietnamese who work in other jobs at the clinic _ from filing medical records to serving as medical assistants _ to translate as needed.
The change has unleashed a flurry of protest by advocacy groups and prompted an investigation by federal civil rights officials into whether refugee patients are being denied ready access to interpreters _ something Montefiore must provide as a condition of receiving federal aid.
Larry Velez, a spokesman for the office of civil rights at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, said his office's inquiry, which began after clinic staff members and patients filed a complaint, was the first in recent memory examining the civil rights of non-English-speaking patients at a New York City hospital.
The investigation at Montefiore, which has long been considered a leader in caring for immigrant New Yorkers, is being watched closely by other health care providers and by immigrants' advocates, who hope to use it as leverage to bolster their demands that hospitals and clinics improve their interpreting services.
Most of the city's hospitals and clinics rely on a patchwork of bilingual staff members, volunteers and, at times, the children of patients to do translation, said Francesca Gany, executive director of the New York Immigrant Task Force on Health.
