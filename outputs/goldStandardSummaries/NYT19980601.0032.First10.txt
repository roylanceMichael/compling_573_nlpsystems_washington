LOS ANGELES _ Republican or Democrat?
David Haro of North Hollywood isn't quite sure which he wants to be yet.
But with the primary election coming up Tuesday, he is feeling pressure from all sides.
Volunteer Connie Begg coaxed him in Spanish to register to vote as a Republican at a Los Angeles Convention Center naturalization ceremony last week that drew hundreds of new citizens.
At the booth next door, Kathy Checchi, wife of gubernatorial candidate Al Checchi, used her fluent Spanish to win over new voters to the Democratic Party.
``Latinos, your vote is your voice,'' bellowed a Democratic recruiter in Spanish.
Begg responded in Spanish, ``You can register with us, it doesn't take much time.''
Tuesday is California's first open primary, in which people may vote across party lines regardless of their registration.
But like never before, Latino voters are being courted, bilingually, by political parties eager to recruit this growing segment of the electorate.
