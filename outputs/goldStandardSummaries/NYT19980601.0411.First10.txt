WASHINGTON _ Astronauts report that one of the most striking visions in space is approaching the Russian Mir space station, which first appears as a distant point of light.
Drawing closer, Mir _ with its cruciform configuration of modules and arrays of wing-like solar panels _ slowly begins to resemble a giant cosmic insect glowing bright against the blackness of space.
Now, visits to this celestial dragonfly by U.S. space shuttle crews are about to end.
After being a focus of U.S. manned space activity for the last three years, stays on Mir are about to join Gemini capsules and Saturn rockets as historical artifacts of the nation's space program.
The shuttle Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir this week and retrieve Andrew Thomas, a U.S. astronaut who has spent four months conducting research on the Russian outpost.
But unlike in a half-dozen previous missions, the shuttle will not be carrying a replacement astronaut.
NASA plans to launch the Discovery Tuesday at 6:10 p.m. with a six-member crew.
During the next 10 days, the shuttle crew is to rendezvous and dock with Mir, transfer more than a ton of supplies to the station while retrieving a like amount of scientific experiments and equipment, and bring Thomas back home.
Thomas, a mechanical engineer, is the last of seven Americans to live and work on Mir during the past three years.
