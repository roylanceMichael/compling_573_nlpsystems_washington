Threats to burn down a theater, kill the staff and ``exterminate'' a playwright will get people's attention every time.
Last week's firestorm over the cancellation and subsequent reinstatement of Terrence McNally's ``Corpus Christi'' at New York's Manhattan Theater Club was felt strongly across the country.
The result was a heated exercise in spontaneous public discourse.
Ignorance played as big a role as passion in the ``Corpus Christi'' affair, which left the MTC scraping egg from its blushing face, turned the playwright into a unwitting hero of artistic freedom, and raised all sorts of fears that intimidation could be a successful strategy to influence what gets seen and what doesn't on stage.
With the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights squared off against a squadron of outraged playwrights and the National Coalition Against Censorship, ``Corpus Christi'' was once and forever politicized.
Will anyone be able to see McNally's play, once it gets on, without thinking of it as a theatrical equivalent to Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs?
Never mind what the play actually portrays or whether it succeeds artistically.
The play-that-got-banned label, inaccurate as it is, will both enhance and obscure its reception.
The unfinished play, according to those who have read a draft, deals with a modern-day Jesus figure named Joshua who is gay and has sex with his disciples.
