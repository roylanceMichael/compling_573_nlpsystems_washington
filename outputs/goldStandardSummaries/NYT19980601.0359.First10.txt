WASHINGTON _ They call them the Righteous Brothers.
James Dobson, Gary Bauer and John Ashcroft are the vanguard of a new conservative Christian movement that is marching on Washington.
After some years in the political wilderness, America's religious right is back.
Social conservatives feel that the Republican Party has taken them for granted, led them down the garden path and given nothing back in return.
They want an end to abortion, gay rights and gun control, and their demands are causing uproar in the party as America gears up for elections.
Imagine Britain's Labour Party of the early 1980s crossed with the schisms of the early Church, and you're close.
Dobson, 62, is a broadcaster based in Colorado Springs, Colo. Bauer, 51, a former Reagan Administration official, heads the Family Research Council.
Ashcroft, 56, is a senator from Missouri.
They are the heirs to a tradition of religious conservatism in America that helped keep Ronald Reagan in office for eight years.
