Even in a season ripe with Civil War fiction, regular readers of Kaye Gibbons may be surprised that the North Carolina writer's newest novel has taken a turn toward the historical.
Gibbons, more noted for her contemporary family stories, has just published ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon'' (Putnam, $22.95), which begins in 1842 with protagonist Emma Garnet chronicling her life at Seven Oaks, her father's Virginia plantation.
Emma's father is a tyrant who verbally abuses his wife and six children.
He treats the servants even worse, except for Clarice, a strong woman who opens Emma's eyes to the brutality of slavery.
Emma escapes by marrying a Northern doctor, Dr. Quincy Lowell, and moving to Raleigh.
But what begins as a harmonious life is soon shattered by the war.
``The Civil War presents a bottomless bounty,'' Gibbons says.
``I've always been interested in crucibles of history and I love research.
So for a year and a half I sat on the sun porch of the house and read and took notes.''
