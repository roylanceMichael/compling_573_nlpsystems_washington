Monotheism doesn't suit the world of popular music; that world has too many great performers.
The pleasure I have always taken in Frank Sinatra's best singing is being tainted by the ``thou shalt have no other singer'' eulogies and by the cultural studies, conferences and papers still to come.
Rock 'n' roll never stopped me from loving the truly wonderful Sinatra recordings of the 1950s.
And loving those recordings never stopped me from lamenting and resenting the songs, the singing and the persona that appeared in the mid-'60s and prevailed until his death.
The voice and the man grew coarse.
The easy swagger became belligerent, and the melancholy turned brashly sentimental.
Artists don't need to be remembered for anything but their best work.
But they don't need to have that work enshrined in a mythology that places them above all others and will soon pass into (and pass itself off as) history and criticism.
Jule Styne was a good songwriter, but how can anyone let his famous comment about Sinatra stand?
