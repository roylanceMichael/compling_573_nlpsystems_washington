If Bob Costas pursued NBC's original plan, he would be completing his eighth season of National Basketball Association play-by-play.
But he chose to be host of the studio show for seven years, deferring to Marv Albert to call games.
Now, Costas is wrapping up his first season of play-by-play in 18 years, and he confesses to preferring calling games to being the studio host.
``I'm sorry about the way it happened,'' he said Monday from St. Louis, referring to Albert's legal woes.
``But it's much more fun doing play-by-play.
You feel so much more a part of the league and the games, and it involves more.
It's more like an orchestra; there are more elements to take care of.''
On being hermetically sealed in NBC's New York studio, Costas said, ``I missed sitting and talking to sports people, to people in the lobby, in the coffee shop, picking up tidbits, being at the shoot-arounds.''
He added: ``The NBA studio wasn't the challenge this is.
