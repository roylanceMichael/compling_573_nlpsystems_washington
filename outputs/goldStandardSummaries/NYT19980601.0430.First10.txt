``NewsRadio'' has always been considered the tough little show that could, living the perilous life of a series mighty close to being axed, yet surviving at the last possible moment with a miraculous reprieve.
But can it survive this?
Phil Hartman's death last week, reportedly at the hands of his wife, who later fatally shot herself, has the creators of the NBC situation comedy shaken and perplexed about exactly how to move on.
The series, which will start its fourth season in the fall, focused on the quirky workaday lives of the staff of a struggling radio station.
Hartman had been part of a relatively unknown though deeply talented ensemble cast, playing Bill McNeal, the manipulative news anchor with a healthy respect for himself and a mere tolerance for others.
It's hard enough to write major characters out of the script without enduring some viewer backlash, as ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' and ``NYPD Blue'' will find out next season without their respective stars, Andre Braugher and Jimmy Smits.
But when a regular character dies, putting producers in the position of writing out a character without the character being around, you have to address it in a way that's both apropos and sensible for an audience that is, for the most part, grieving for a fictional character to whom they can't give a proper farewell.
When John Hancock, 51, died of a heart attack at his Los Angeles home in 1992, he was co-starring in the CBS comedy ``Love and War'' as the gruff but lovable bartender of a bar frequented by the show's romantic leads, played by Susan Dey and Jay Thomas.
Series creator Diane English shut down production for a week.
