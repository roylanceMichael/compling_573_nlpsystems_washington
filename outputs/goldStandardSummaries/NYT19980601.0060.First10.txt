I am not looking for your sympathy when I reveal that several times in my life I have found myself in Milwaukee.
&QL;    It is an occupational hazard for journalists.
Keep at this oddness long enough and eventually you find yourself in Milwaukee.
And sooner or later you will regret something about Milwaukee.
&QL;    Perhaps the best time I ever had in Milwaukee was in 1976 when I was trailing around the late Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who was running for president again with no hope of winning but with too many good ideas to go to bed at night without having shared them with somebody who could vote.
&QL;    We were in the kitchen of someone's Milwaukee house for a fund-raiser, and McCarthy was regaling the crowd with spectacularly funny baseball stories from back when he played in the Sioux League or some such in Minnesota or wherever.
As you can tell, details of McCarthy's baseball stories have become far too sketchy for me to recount here.
&QL;    It turns out, by the way, that spending campaign time entertaining people in Milwaukee kitchens with hilarious baseball stories is no way to get to the White House.
Remember that if you long to be the most powerful human being in the world.
