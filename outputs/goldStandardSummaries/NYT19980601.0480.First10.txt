WASHINGTON _ Concerned about the growing power of leftist rebels in Colombia, the Clinton administration is expanding its support for government forces fighting in the hemisphere's longest-running guerrilla war.
U.S. officials say the aid is aimed at stanching the flow of illegal drugs from Colombia, and will target the insurgents only where they protect the production of heroin and cocaine.
The officials say they have no intention of getting mired in Colombia's internal conflict.
But government documents and interviews with dozens of officials here indicate that the separation Washington has tried to make between those two campaigns _ one against drug trafficking, the other against the guerrillas _ is increasingly breaking down.
Officials say more U.S. training and equipment are going to shore up basic deficiencies in the tactics, mobility and firepower of the Colombian military, rather than for operations directed at the drug trade.
Faced with a string of rebel victories, including a devastating ambush of Colombian troops in March, U.S. generals have embarked on an ambitious effort to help reorganize the Colombian army.
According to senior U.S. officials, the Clinton administration has also been considering options that officials said include additional military training, provision of more sophisticated helicopters and materiel, and creation of a high-tech intelligence center that would be run by U.S. officials on Colombian soil.
The limits of U.S. involvement in Colombia are still largely set by the constraints on military, intelligence and foreign-aid spending in the aftermath of the Cold War.
Compared with the billions of dollars poured into Central America during the 1980s, the hundred million or so that the United States now spends annually on Colombia remains relatively modest.
