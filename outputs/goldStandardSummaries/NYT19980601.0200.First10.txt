WASHINGTON _ He opposed restrictions on abortion, supported gays in the military and thought Pat Robertson's religious right was a bunch of ``kooks.''
To hear the television news and read the obituaries, you might have thought that Barry Goldwater was a liberal.
Of course the right-wing senator from Arizona who died on Friday was a liberal, in many of the ways that the word is used in Britain.
He was in the Manchester tradition, a foe of government intervention and an individualist.
In America being a liberal means being something else _ a friend of the state _ and so Goldwater's lifelong crusade was against liberalism.
But in his later years he found himself often at odds with the Republican Party, over abortion, school prayers and gay rights, as they became more authoritarian.
Nonetheless, the ease with which the mainstream media in America slid into eulogy was slightly disturbing.
``Barry Goldwater was a politician who stood by his own salty views,'' the New York Times said in an editorial, failing to point out that it had long regarded most of these salty views as a grave threat to the nation.
He had, after all, saltily suggested using low-yield nuclear weapons in Vietnam.
