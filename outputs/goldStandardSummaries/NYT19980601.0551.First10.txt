Leonard Zeskind of Kansas City, Mo., has been working for two decades to increase awareness of hate groups, and in 1983 he founded the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights.
Now, with a $295,000 windfall as a MacArthur Fellow, he hopes to complete his book on the white supremacist movement in the United States.
Zeskind, 48, is among the 29 new MacArthur Fellows announced Monday by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago, which awards stipends to innovators to liberate them from financial constraints.
In addition to Zeskind, the fellows for 1998 are:    Janine Antoni, 34, New York, an artist who mixes traditional sculpture and conceptual art, $225,000.
Ida Applebroog, 68, New York, a painter and social critic, $375,000.
