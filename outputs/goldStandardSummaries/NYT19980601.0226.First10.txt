PARIS _ With less than two weeks to go before the soccer World Cup kicks off in Paris on June 10, France has got the jitters.
The month-long series of 64 games, featuring 32 teams from around the world, is expected to be watched, at least once, by a billion or so viewers.
What a wonderful chance for a publicity seeker.
Terrorists, soccer hooligans and striking transport workers are all threatening to spoil the fun _ and sully the proud host's image around the world.
On May 26, nearly 100 people suspected of links with Algerian Muslim extremists were arrested in dawn raids in five European countries (Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and France) at the request of France's leading anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis Bruguiere.
No explosives and only one firearm were found, but the interior ministry said that months of surveillance had led it to believe that ``terrorist activities were being prepared in the World Cup's run-up.''
Three of the 53 nabbed in France live barely a grenade's throw from a sparkling new 80,000-seat stadium in Paris's northern suburbs, where nine matches, including the final, are to be played.
Two weeks earlier, an unexploded bomb had been found in front of France Telecom's offices in Paris's northeast.
No one has claimed responsibility, but the bomb was like the ones used in a wave of attacks in France inspired by Algerian extremists in 1995, when ten people were killed and more than 150 injured.
