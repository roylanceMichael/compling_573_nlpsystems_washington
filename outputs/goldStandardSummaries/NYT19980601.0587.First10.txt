NEW YORK _ Broadening their efforts to limit what they see as dangerous congestion on New York City's sidewalks, city officials said Monday that their vending ban would include not only food carts but also street sales of books, baseball cards, art, T-shirts and all other goods.
The ambitious enforcement plan targets yet another signature of the Manhattan streetscape and potentially courts a First Amendment battle, according to opponents of the restrictions.
The widening of the ban also gives food vendors a host of potential new allies as they seek to build opposition to the rules by staging a citywide shutdown of the carts on Wednesday.
The new restrictions, to be enforced by the police beginning in about mid-July, cover 144 blocks of Manhattan, including much of the financial district and several stretches of midtown.
In the past, the city has designated some areas where food vending was prohibited and others where vending of general merchandise like clothing was banned.
Peddlers of books and other printed matter were accorded the widest latitude because of their First Amendment rights.
But Earl Andrews Jr., chairman of the city's Sidewalk Vendor Review Panel, which approved the 144-block ban, said the restrictions approved by the panel applied to vendors of both food and general merchandise, and thus covered artists and those who sell printed matter.
``If a street is congested, it's going to be congested, whether it's a food vendor or a general vendor,'' said Andrews, who is commissioner of the Department of Business Services.
``All vending should exist in an area where there is no congestion and no threat to the safety of the citizens and the flow of traffic.''
