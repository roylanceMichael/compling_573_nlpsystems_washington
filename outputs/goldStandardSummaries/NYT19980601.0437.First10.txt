JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Kenneth Kaunda, the former president of Zambia, was set free on Monday after prosecutors dropped charges that he had a role in a botched coup attempt last year.
Kaunda, who led Zambia to independence from Britain and ruled it for 27 years, had been in jail or under house arrest for nearly six months, barred from speaking to his supporters or the media.
He was apparently released released in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, as part of a deal brokered by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, whom he thanked in brief remarks on the steps of the courthouse while hundreds of cheering supporters crowded around him.
The case against Kaunda had always appeared weak.
Two weeks ago, Mandela sent his defense minister to Zambia on a shuttle diplomacy mission between Kaunda and Zambia's President Frederick Chiluba, a South African government representative said.
No one would officially disclose details of the deal, but it is said to include Kaunda's agreement to retire from politics permanently.
He said at the courthouse on Monday that ``nothing can stop me'' from pursuing his campaign against Chiluba.
But in a later speech outside the headquarters of his United National Independence Party, he said he was calling a party congress to elect a new leader.
Kaunda was arrested on Christmas Day and accused of being behind a brief coup on Oct. 28 in which army officers led by a ``Captain Solo'' invaded the house of the army chief of staff and the national radio station.
