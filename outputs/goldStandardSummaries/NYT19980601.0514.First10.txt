Networks can pay huge dividends by letting employees swap files, share printers and hop onto the Internet at will.
But they used to require expensive consultants, exotic hardware and complicated software, making them something to avoid whenever possible.
Improved technology has slashed the cost and complexity of networks.
Today, even an amateur can set up a network for a few hundred dollars and a few hours' time.
On the hardware side, a network requires two or more computers, each with a network interface card inside.
It needs a central box called a ``hub'' to which the computers all connect.
And it needs cables to link the network cards to the hub.
&LR;   &LR; Computer catalogs and stores are full of such devices these days.
For software, a simple network needs only Windows 95 on every PC.
