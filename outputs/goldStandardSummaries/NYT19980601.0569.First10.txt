HIGH FALLS, N.Y. _ Karen Pardini and Michael Fink, two middle-aged children of the back-to-the-land 1960s, had long had their eyes on a largely untamed patch in the Shawangunk Mountains.
So when the land became available in 1986, they cobbled together a down payment to buy 211 acres and began fixing up a tumbledown barn.
For eight years, they camped out in woods and took pleasure in their land, sometimes hiking to a ridge at the end of their property to savor the soaring views of the Catskills.
Then one day, as Ms. Pardini walked along the road that cuts across her property, she noticed pink and yellow ribbons put up by a local surveyor.
Someone else, she realized, coveted her property.
It eventually turned out there was a claimant, and it was not a wily real estate speculator but a land preservation group, the Shawangunk Conservancy.
The conservancy, one of 1,100 such groups nationwide that pride themselves on their ethics by buying from willing sellers with unclouded titles, had long desired the land as a missing link in a 50-mile chain of ridgeland that it wants to render forever wild for the pleasure of hikers and climbers.
The group produced two unorthodox deeds that, it argued, proved that it now had possession of almost half of the land Fink and Ms. Pardini thought they owned.
In the long, nasty quarrel that followed, a judge ruled in March that the conservancy's deeds were worthless and said Ms. Pardini and Fink could sue for fraud.
