WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in an effort to avoid a showdown in the Supreme Court, sidestepped a fight Monday over executive privilege to prevent two White House aides from testifying in independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation of the Monica S. Lewinsky matter.
Instead, White House lawyers will prolong their battle with Starr by pursuing Clinton's claim that his conversations with deputy counsel Bruce R. Lindsey are shielded from Starr's inquiry by attorney-client privilege.
The White House move, laid out in a Supreme Court motion, was seen as having stymied Starr's request last week that the justices make a rare, urgent ruling in the dispute over testimony by presidential aides.
By dropping the executive privilege appeal, White House lawyers said there was no reason for the Supreme Court to act before its upcoming summer recess.
``The fate of the nation will not hang in the balance,'' the White House asserted in its Supreme Court motion.
The latest White House strategy was seen as possibly sparing Clinton the embarrassment of oral arguments before the Supreme Court that might prompt comparisons between him and President Richard M. Nixon's effort not to disclose Watergate tapes.
Starr, apparently anticipating the White House move, indirectly criticized Clinton's lawyers in a speech to a county bar association in Charlotte, N.C.
He said defense lawyers ``have a duty not to use their skills to impede the search for truth.''
Starr is investigating whether Clinton lied under oath about his relationship with Lewinsky or obstructed justice by trying to cover up an alleged affair.
