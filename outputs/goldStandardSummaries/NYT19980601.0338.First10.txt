Americans will be traveling more this summer, and _ in spite of lower gasoline prices _ spending more in the process, according to the Travel Industry Association of America and AAA.
&QL;    United States travelers will take a total of 251 million ``person trips'' (a family of four taking a trip together counts as four person-trips).
&QL;    That number is an increase of 3 percent, on top of a 9 percent jump in 1997, according to a survey undertaken by the Travel Industry Association of America.
That family of four will spend $218 a day on meals and lodging, $19 more than it spent last year, according to a survey of vacation costs by AAA.
&QL;    Florida, California and Hawaii continue to top the list of places Americans most want to visit.
&QL;    Just over half of the 1,500 travelers surveyed, 51 percent, will be taking children _ either their own or grandchildren _ up from 43 percent last year.
&QL;    For the first time travelers were asked if they expected to attend a family reunion this year, and 25 percent said yes; the proportion was the same among travelers with children and those without.
&QL;    _Janet Piorko &QL;   &QL;    Yes, you may have to duck a flying cow at the latest attraction at Universal Studios Florida.
In Twister ... Ride It Out, based on the movie ``Twister,'' the cow is from a sign, however, not a farm.
