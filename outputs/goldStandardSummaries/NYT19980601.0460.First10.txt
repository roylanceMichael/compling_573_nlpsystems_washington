AUSTIN, Texas _ If Houston attorney Joe Jamail has information that Attorney General Dan Morales improperly solicited millions of dollars in the tobacco case, he should be allowed to tell his story under oath, a spokeswoman for Gov.
George W. Bush said Monday.
Karen Hughes, the governor's communications director, said Bush isn't involved in the effort to question Jamail.
That dispute pits Morales against seven legislators and their attorneys.
But she added: ``Joe Jamail has made it clear he wants to be deposed ...
If that's the case, we see no harm in letting the facts come out.''
In separate court challenges, the governor and the seven lawmakers are trying to block $2.3 billion in legal fees awarded to five other private attorneys who helped Morales obtain the $15.3 billion tobacco settlement.
They believe the fees are excessive.
According to a document the legislators filed in federal court last week, Morales solicited $1 million from each of several lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco lawsuit.
