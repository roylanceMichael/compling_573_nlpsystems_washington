ATLANTA _ How do you get on _ or off _ all those direct mail and telemarketing lists?
There are many ways, easy ways, to get on the lists.
To get off the lists _ and stay off _ is not so simple.
One way of getting on lists was revealed this month when American Express announced it would sell certain purchasing information about its card holders to retailers, who could then send advertisements or other sales promotions to them.
But American Express card holders should not feel alone.
Every time you provide your name and address to buy a product or service, including many bank credit card purchases, there's a good chance you eventually will be added to other marketing lists.
Lists of names and addresses and telephone numbers are compiled by marketers from countless sources, including the telephone book.
Such a list, of course, is too general for most marketers who want more specialized ``response'' lists of consumers who have bought certain kinds of merchandise that indicate they might respond to similar offers.
Numerous telemarketers and direct mail firms, including some mail order catalogs and magazines, sell, rent or ``share'' their lists.
