&UR;  &LR; The nation's accounting rulemakers said Monday that they had given final approval to a new rule that will force companies to record the value of derivatives in their financial statements.
The move was immediately criticized by the banking industry and other groups, who have complained so loudly in Washington about the proposed rule in recent months that a bill has been introduced to weaken the power of the private rule-making body, known as the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Edmund Jenkins, the chairman of the accounting board, said that the new rule was needed to help protect investors in cases where companies may be investing heavily in derivatives that could result in huge losses.
He added that the intense criticism had made it even more important for the board to act.
Several years ago, the accounting board decided to weaken another proposed rule on the accounting of employee stock options after companies complained to Congress.
``If the board had backed down on derivatives, I think it would have made it very difficult for the board to be an effective standard setter in the future,'' Jenkins said.
``It is crucial that we have independent standard setting.''
The seven members of the accounting board voted unanimously to approve the new rule during balloting that concluded late last week.
Derivatives are complicated financial contracts between two or more parties where the contract's value is tied to an underlying asset or pre-existing index.
