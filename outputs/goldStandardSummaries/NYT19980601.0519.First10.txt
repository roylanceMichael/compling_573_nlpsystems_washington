The Year 2000 problem stems from a shortcut used by computer programmers in the 1960s and '70s to store only the last two digits of a year _ ``74'' instead of ``1974,'' for example.
It could cause computers to read January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900, which in turn could bollix accounting, payroll, tax and customer billing records, inventories and supplier relations.
``We feel this is a very serious issue,'' said Dan Hill, director of the Small Business Administration's office of technology in Washington, D.C. ``Every small business should address it.''
&UR;  &LR;    There are plenty of organizations _ including the SBA, Microsoft, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a host of technology-service providers _ that are eager to help.
But businesses must make the first move, by seeking that help.
A new study sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank found that 82 percent of all small businesses are ``at risk'' for Year 2000-related problems, yet fewer than a third are taking the matter seriously enough to act.
Many small businesses believe the problem can't affect them if their computers are relatively new and they recently bought programs off the shelf from established vendors such as Microsoft.
It's true that most modern hardware and software come free of Year 2000 (Y2K) problems.
But even these computer systems can become contaminated, Hill warns, ``if you've modified your software _ for example by bringing in a file you had before that was not Y2K-compliant.''
