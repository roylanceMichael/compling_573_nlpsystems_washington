CHICAGO _ Ladies and gentlemen: May we present ``The Jordanaires, featuring Michael Jordan.''
This wasn't one of those ``MICHAEL JORDAN and someotherguys'' affairs.
This was one of the hard-est games Michael Jordan ever has had to play.
He will be getting on a plane for Salt Lake City Tuesday only because members of what he long ago referred to as his ``supporting cast'' picked him up on a night when he was exceedingly mortal with a basketball in his hands.
In the midst of Chicago's 88-83 Game 7 victory over the Indiana Pacers, he did flirt with a triple-double (28 points, 9 rebounds, 8 assists).
He did put the flypaper defense on Reggie Miller in the fourth quarter, limiting the Indiana Stickman to one field goal attempt.
Once you got past his 9-for-25 shooting, the fact that Jordan only made one jump shot in the entire second half, and the fact that he was uncharacteristically pedestrian at the free-throw line (10 for 15), he did other things to help his team win the game, things that offer testimony to his true greatness.
``What you saw is why he's the best player in the league, and why he's the best player ever,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird.
``I know that when my shooting was off I tried to get on the boards and make passes.
