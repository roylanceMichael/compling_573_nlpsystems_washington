I don't usually hand out bold advice I wouldn't take myself.
Still, I was glad to hear the Manhattan Theater Club of New York City, which has a reputation for presenting new plays and talent, has decided to go ahead with a touchy play after getting threats said to come from Catholic extremists.
The play was fated for controversy.
Details are sketchy.
The New York Times hears the play is about 13 gay men celebrating the passion of Christ and sex is involved.
Furious protests arrived punctually, threatening death to playwright, theater staff and actors.
The play was canceled, then reinstated a week later after intellectuals squawked censorship.
Catholics are hardly alone in objecting when values are affronted.
Name an ethnic or religious group, and you'll find an insult that cannot be trivialized out of existence.
