George Strait is elusive.
Really elusive.
In fact, George Strait is so elusive, his press agent, Kay West in Nashville, is essentially an answering machine.
Since 1982, I've left approximately 55 messages for Kay/George in pursuit of interviews or information and received approximately five return calls.
Nonetheless, nearly two decades of my life have been spent in journalistic pursuit of this Sinatra of South Texas.
To date, the sum total of my efforts has been one (1) phone interview, in 1984, and one (1) in-person interview, in 1992.
And that's actually a pretty good record for a Strait newshound; other longtime country music writers have NEVER scored an interview with him.
The phone interview in 1984 was a 15-minute conversation done from George's ranch in South Texas, as he and the Ace in the Hole Band were literally loading up to go on tour.
He told me that, no offense intended, he didn't much like doing interviews, and he refused to use his free time to do them.
