NEW YORK _ Jack Nicklaus has designed golf courses in the desert, on tropical islands and in remote wooded areas.
But building a golf course on a Bronx garbage heap should rank as one of his most creative projects.
Nicklaus' company has released only a preliminary sketch of a design for the course, to be built on 175 marshy and undeveloped acres in Ferry Point Park.
It is hard to predict what sort of course golfers should expect, because Nicklaus prides himself on variety, and the characteristics and terrain of a site go a long way toward determining what kind of course he creates.
But there is certainly reason to be optimistic about the quality of the layout.
The list of courses that Nicklaus has designed, either as the project chief or as a consultant, is impressive.
Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, the sight of the Memorial Tournament that was won by Fred Couples on Sunday, is regarded as one of the world's finest courses.
While Muirfield may be Nicklaus' best work, his other acclaimed courses include Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario; Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Miss.
; Castle Pines Golf Club in Castle Rock, Colo., and Grand Cypress in Orlando.
