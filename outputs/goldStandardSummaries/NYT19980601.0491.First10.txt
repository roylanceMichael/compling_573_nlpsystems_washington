WASHINGTON _ Religious conservatives won a victory in Congress last month, and Republicans on Capitol Hill were only too glad to give it to them.
By a wide margin, the House passed a bill to punish religious persecution abroad with economic retaliation.
But by quieting the rumblings on its right wing, the GOP upset another important friend _ corporate America.
The division over the religious persecution bill reflects continuing friction in the GOP's base.
Some business leaders are unhappy that the party's social and religious agenda has in several cases trumped its traditional business concerns.
``A lot of American companies are kind of scratching their heads about this `pro-business Republican Congress,' '' said Willard Workman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who deals with international business concerns.
Arne Owens, a spokesman for the Christian Coalition, dismissed business' concerns about the bill as ``much ado about nothing from an economic and trade perspective.''
He said they reflected ``a callousness on the part of some in the business community to be quite willing to place the profit-making above all else.''
But Richard O'Leary, who is chairman of the board of H Enterprises, a Minneapolis company involved in machinery and construction, and who also sits on the chamber's international and economic policy committees, said, ``We now have the social agenda of the month driving our policies that affect international trade and our standing internationally.''
