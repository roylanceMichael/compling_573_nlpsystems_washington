We have determined that men and women define ``fun'' differently.
(See last month's column on Viagra.)
So it stands to reason that ``vacation'' is also a disputed concept.
Not that anyone takes vacations in the '90s.
We don't even take lunch.
Vacation is for academics and the French, people who can dally at the shore for months at a time.
Our summer is a two-week dash, jammed between camp and Scouts.
Since I spend most of my working days in a concrete box, I long for a breath of air during my brief time off.
A little walk in the woods.
