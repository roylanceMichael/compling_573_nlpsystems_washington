FORT WORTH, Texas _ There's a new word before the Texas in Texas Motor Speedway.
Reconfigured.
Or Revamped.
Or, it's hoped, Improved.
``It's a completely different racetrack,'' said Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of the track.
The 1.5-mile trioval has undergone an estimated $2 million to $3 million overhaul just in time for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series' Pronto Auto Parts 400-kilometer race Friday night and the Pep Boys Indy Racing League's True Value 500K event Saturday night.
There's a new drainage system, pipes and sump pumps in place, designed to let rainwater flow under the track and prevent the seepage problems that plagued the 24-degree banking in turns 1 and 4 during the NASCAR Winston Cup Texas 500 in April.
The transitions into Turn 1 and out of Turn 4 have been altered by raising the outside walls in those areas and adding as much as 45 inches of pavement against the concrete.
The infamous eight-degree ``dual-banking'' has been removed and the entire track repaved with a tighter asphalt mix.
