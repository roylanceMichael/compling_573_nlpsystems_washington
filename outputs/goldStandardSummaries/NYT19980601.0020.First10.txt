ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Unless the Mariners lower their fair-value-in-return expectations, they apparently will have a hard time granting left-hander Randy Johnson's request to be traded.
Although Johnson has pitched superb back-to-back games since having a meeting with manager Lou Piniella in Texas nearly two weeks ago and being told the best way to get traded is to pitch better, the flurry of recent trade talk hasn't materialized into a deal.
The Los Angeles Dodgers rejected a proposal that would send right-handed pitcher Darren Dreifort, along with infielder/outfielder Wilton Guerrero to the Mariners, and the New York Yankees refuse to deal left-hander Andy Pettitte.
A source close to the Yankees said Sunday that starting pitcher Ramiro Mendoza and minor-league outfielder Ricky Ledee have been offered, but the M's insist on getting Pettitte, off limits despite having a sub-par season (6-5 record).
The source said general manager Brian Cashman is interested in Johnson, but in no hurry to make a deal.
The Yankees are runaway leaders in the American League East and believe the Mariners will take less for Johnson closer to the July 31 trading deadline.
With the Dodgers also apparently ready to wait for the price to come down, the trade talk that was roaring last week has quieted and Johnson appears to be getting anxious.
He met with Piniella again Sunday for nearly 45 minutes.
Neither would discuss the gist of the session.
