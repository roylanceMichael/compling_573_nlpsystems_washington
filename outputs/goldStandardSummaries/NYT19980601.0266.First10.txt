SCI-MIR (Undated) _ Visits to the Russian space station Mir by American space shuttle crews are about to end.
After being a focus of U.S. manned space activity for the past three years, stays on Mir are about to join Gemini capsules and Saturn rockets as historical artifacts of the nation's space program.
The shuttle Discovery is scheduled to dock with Mir later this week and retrieve astronaut Andrew Thomas, the last of seven American to work on the station in the last three years.
