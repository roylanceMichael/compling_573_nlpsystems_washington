ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York City's 44,000 taxicab drivers are under fire as an industry for driving recklessly and behaving crudely to their passengers and pedestrians.
Most of the drivers _ some estimate 90 percent _ are immigrants, mostly from South Asia, but also from the Caribbean and Latin America.
They came to the United States seeking a chance for a better life than it was possible for them to have in their native countries, as had so many immigrants before them.
And, as for many immigrants, the streets and buildings of New York City are where they begin their ``pursuit of happiness'' on the lowest rungs of the American economic ladder.
When immigrants try to make it in America, they almost always have a hard time, doing the sort of jobs that those already on the premises regard as beneath them.
Today's immigrants are no different.
The cabbies among them quickly discover that driving in New York City is a hard way to earn a living.
Also dangerous.
Drivers are easy prey for petty criminals trying to pick up easy money, thieves who often don't limit themselves to stealing, but can be viciously violent.
