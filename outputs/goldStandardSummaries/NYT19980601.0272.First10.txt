At the intersection of VFW Parkway and LaGrange Street in West Roxbury there is a sign that stands like a silent sentry reminding us of a proud past filled with a quiet sadness that lingers still across all the years even though the American memory seems to have less and less capacity to recall the cruel and true costs of war.
It is a memorial to brothers _ Thomas and Gerald Keenan _ who died in 1944.
Each day, thousands pass through the busy crossroads.
And, each day, the sign is there, nearly invisible to those idling in autos: ``Keenan Memorial Square,'' the top line reads.
``Thomas W. Jr. _ US Marines, 1920-1944.''
And, right beside the brief reference to that young man, ``Gerald J.
_ US Navy, 1925-1944.
Brothers who gave the supreme sacrifice for their country.''
For a long time I wondered about those brave boys.
