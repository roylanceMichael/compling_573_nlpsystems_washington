SAN FRANCISCO _ The retreat of El Nino should mean a calmer overall hurricane season for Hawaii and the tropical Pacific, but storm watchers warn the early part of the season could see a repeat of last summer's violent tropical storms.
Monday marked the beginning of the 1998 hurricane season in the central Pacific.
Hurricane season runs through Nov. 15 in the eastern Pacific and through October in the central Pacific.
Many scientists say the 1997-98 El Nino, an oceanwide warming of the Pacific's surface temperatures, is waning.
Nevertheless, this El Nino, one of the biggest ever recorded, may still cause storm trouble.
The federal Climate Prediction Center forecasts above-normal water temperatures in the equatorial eastern Pacific through midsummer before approaching normal conditions by early fall.
``Based on this forecast, there may be a tendency to have an increase in the number of tropical cyclones during the early part of the hurricane season,'' said Jim Weyman, director of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.
But he admits there is no certainty.
``The formation, growth, movement and dissipation of tropical cyclones are governed by many complex factors, only one of which is warm ocean water,'' Weyman said.
