Q.
My husband and I are in our late 40s and our main financial goal is to retire in 12 years when our $85,000 mortgage is paid off.
We earn $65,000 combined, and have these savings: $70,000 in stock IRAs to which we make the maximum allowed contributions, $44,500 in eight taxable mutual fund accounts, mostly dominated by stocks; $62,000 in blue-chip stocks, and $50,000 in a company savings plan, with 80 percent of this in Textron stock.
What would you estimate the value of these investments in 12 years if no contributions were made beyond fully funding the IRAs?
Should I sell some of the individual stocks, perhaps to pay down the mortgage?
J.J., Sharon    &UR; UFanswer &LR; If we assume 10 percent average annual growthover that time, you would have $800,287.
The problem is that while I believe 10 percent is reasonable for long-term stock market growth, I'm not particularly happy with it for the next 12 years.
I've long thought it was time for the market to take a rest, and the way things seem to be going that rest might last for some time.
Remember, from the highs of the late 1960s, it took about a decade for the Dow to return to those levels (although to be fair, the Dow is a narrow measure, and those statistics don't include dividends).
