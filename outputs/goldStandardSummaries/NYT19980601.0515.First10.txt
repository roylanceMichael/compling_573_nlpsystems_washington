The CrossPoint VirtualPBX is just that.
It lets small firms whose employees frequently work from home or on the road look to the rest of the world like a big office with a $100,000 phone system.
And the best part is, there's no up-front investment.
The service is offered by Advanced Queuing Systems in San Francisco ( &LR; www.aqsys.com &LR; ).
AQS put all the fancy telephone-switch intelligence in its computer network, freeing customers from having to pay for and install a complex phone system in their offices.
Each customer gets a toll-free 800 or 888 number for incoming calls.
When a caller dials an employee extension, the call is routed to any of several numbers specified by the employee, such as a home number, branch office, cell phone, pager or a client site.
Custom music or messages play while the caller waits for the transfer.
The system also comes with voice mail, call screening, dial-by-name directories and a fancy feature called automated call distribution, or ACD, usually found only in high-end systems.
