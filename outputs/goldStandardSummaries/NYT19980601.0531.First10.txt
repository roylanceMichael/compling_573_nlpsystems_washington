NEW YORK _ In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceuticals industry, American Home Products Corp. announced on Monday that it would acquire Monsanto Co. for $34.4 billion in stock.
The combined company will be the nation's top seller of prescription drugs and a world leader in insecticides and other agricultural products.
The company's name brands also include such household names as Advil painkiller, Centrum vitamins and Nutra Sweet sugar substitute.
The deal surprised Wall Street, which had long expected American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., to sell its agricultural business instead of expand it.
Yet, by merging with Monsanto, American Home Products will be able to double its research spending to $3 billion annually, add several new drugs to its pipeline and bolster its position in genomics research, a process which uses genes to develop drug compounds.
``We started talking recently and it made sense to put our companies together,'' said John Stafford, the chairman of American Home Products.
``We will have a new company with global presence that can deliver the new (Monsanto drug) products to the market.
We'll be number three or four in the world when it comes to pharmaceuticals, up from number six.''
Investors reacted coolly to the deal.
