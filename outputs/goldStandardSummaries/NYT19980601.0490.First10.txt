JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Suddenly, after decades of repression, Indonesia feels like a country without rules _ and that, for many people here, is as frightening as it is exhilarating.
Political prisoners are being freed.
The once tightly controlled press has slipped its leash.
Students are holding sit-ins in provincial government buildings.
People are speaking their minds.
These things were almost unheard of under President Suharto, who stepped down nearly two weeks ago after running Indonesia for 32 years as if it were his kingdom.
Already since his departure, a new Indonesia is in the making, but its shape is unknown.
``Everything is in flux,'' said Goenawan Mohamad, the editor of the magazine Tempo, which was shut down by the government in 1994 but now plans to reopen.
``Things can change tomorrow in a moment.''
