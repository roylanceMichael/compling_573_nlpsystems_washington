WASHINGTON _ Now that India has shown the world that it could quietly purify enough plutonium for the five nuclear devices it detonated recently _ and probably enough for many more _ attention is turning to how to divorce nuclear weapons from nuclear power plants.
A small company based here says it has the answer, by substituting thorium for some of the uranium in fuel for power reactors.
The company, Radkowsky Thorium Power Corp., headed by a physicist who was formerly the chief scientist of the U.S.
Naval Propulsion Program, says its fuel could be used in existing reactors in place of the ordinary uranium fuel, and would produce very little plutonium, a normal byproduct of the reaction when uranium is used.
The company plans to test its fuel in 2002 in a Russian reactor that resembles the dominant U.S. design.
Proponents say it could also be offered to countries like North Korea and Cuba, which say they want reactors to generate electric power.
But some fear they want reactors mostly to generate plutonium for weapons.
The thorium reactor could also be useful for burning up surplus weapons plutonium _ the United States has at least 50 tons of it _ without producing nearly as much new plutonium as existing reactors do.
And the plutonium it does produce would be a mix of types that makes the weapon prone to ``fizzle,'' or sustain a chain reaction for only a brief period, cutting its explosive yield by 95 to 97 percent.
