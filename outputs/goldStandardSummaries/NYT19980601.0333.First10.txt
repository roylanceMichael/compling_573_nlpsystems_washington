The fiercely independent Ani DiFranco is a walking, talking, guitar-strutting rebel.
She's proud of her ``indie girl'' status, her anti-corporate politics, her sexuality, her refusal to sell her music for TV ads, her saying no to the Lilith Fair and Lollapalooza festivals, and the creation of her own label, the Buffalo-based Righteous Babe Records.
Her female empowerment has made her a fascinating subject to the media, even though many analysts forget to mention the most important ingredient of her success _ her music.
``The media rarely get to what I actually do,'' says DiFranco, whose raw, visceral style is best appreciated by the loyal fans who have followed her most of the last decade, but also by the many newcomers who have made her an amphitheater headliner this year for the first time.
``The audience doesn't come to the shows because I believe in independence or in trying to fight corporate forces in the music industry,'' says DiFranco from her Buffalo office.
``I don't think that would sustain them for very long.
They come out to hear the songs and I come out to play them.
And that's really where it lives.''
DiFranco, now 27, has become a folk-punk sensation with an intensity unsurpassed in the acoustic world.
