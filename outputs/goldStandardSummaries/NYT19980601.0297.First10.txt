HOUSTON _ Houston is the fourth largest city in the United States, but it has the dubious honor of being No.
1 in the nation when counting the number of postal workers bitten by dogs.
``Whenever you get a lot of unwanted dogs in the area, you will see a lot of dog bites, and that is the case here in Houston,'' said Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Health and Human Services.
According to the U.S. Humane Society there were 65 dog bites to Houston postal workers in fiscal 1997 _ the most reported in the country.
The Chicago and Miami areas were ranked No.
2 and No.
3, respectively.
James Sanchez isn't surprised that Houston was ranked No.
1.
