ATLANTA _ Is it possible to win a game before it even starts, to catapult a team to the NBA Finals on the force of sheer will and mental influence?
Could Michael Jordan be that good?
Maybe so.
It's too simple to say the Chicago Bulls begin their quest for a second three-peat Wednesday in Salt Lake City against the Utah Jazz as much because of Jordan's words and determination as his skill.
But it is indisputable that his team follows his lead, and he has not abused such responsibility.
``My job is to keep it together,'' Jordan said.
``Sometimes to score, but also sometimes to encourage and sometimes to push.''
After the Indiana Pacers won Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals at Market Square Arena on Friday, the feeling permeated that the Bulls were ripe for the picking.
The champions, who prided themselves on their ability to close out teams on the brink, did not deliver the deciding blow.
