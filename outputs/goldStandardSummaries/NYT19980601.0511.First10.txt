That all changed last year when associates finally convinced her to install a computer network in the three Bay Area offices of Town and Country Nannies and Mothers In Deed.
By themselves, the firm's computers weren't any friendlier than before, but networked together they became too powerful a business tool for Frei to ignore.
The network has made ``a huge, huge difference to our business,'' Frei enthused, noting that employees now share files and communicate far more effectively between offices.
``Our efficiency and thoroughness have increased dramatically.''
Small businesses all over America are discovering similar benefits from letting their computers communicate together.
A computer network lets employees swap files with the push of a button instead of walking from room to room with floppy disks.
It lets them share a high-speed printer instead of wasting desk space and money putting printers by every workstation.
And it permits everyone in the office to share Internet access without the expense of multiple dial-up lines and accounts.
Networks also let offices centralize files on one hard disk,so safety backups become easy and routine rather than onerous and infrequent.
