WASHINGTON _ The U.S.
Postal Service marked the start of National Dog Bite Prevention Week on Monday by identifying the 30 U.S. cities where Postal Service employees were most frequently bitten by dogs.
The list ranks Houston as the No.
1 city, with 65 dog bites in the 12 months ending September 1997, followed by the Chicago area with 55 bites and the Miami area with 36.
More than 2,700 letter carriers were bitten during that period, according to the Postal Service.
Carriers are equipped with pepper spray to ward off attacking dogs, a fact that helps account for the recent reduction in dog bite victims among letter carriers.
In the mid-1980s, more than 7,000 carriers suffered dog bites annually.
During National Dog Bite Prevention Week, post offices around the nation will coordinate with local humane societies and animal care and control officials on public education about avoiding dog bites.
The Postal Service offers this advice on how to avoid a dog bite:    _ Don't run past a dog.
