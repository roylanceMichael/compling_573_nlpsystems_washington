If there is one national issue emerging from the hodgepodge of political campaigns that will take shape with primary elections in eight states on Tuesday, it is health insurance.
Health maintenance organizations have taken over, and voters don't like it.
So politicians are promising to do something about it.
Candidates this fall for the Senate and House as well as governor and state attorney general are rallying behind legislation percolating in Congress and in state legislatures that promises to force HMOs to pay for more care, to expand patient choice and to require health plans to document how well they treat patients.
Political marketing consultants have given these proposals a consumer-friendly name: the ``patients' bill of rights'' _ an idea embraced last week by President Clinton and by his commission on managed care.
Patients' rights have broad support among health policy experts who say they will make insurance companies accountable for the quality of care they provide.
But the experts also know something the politicians won't say.
These bills of rights, the product of a consumer backlash against restrictions imposed by the HMOs, are almost certain to do the opposite of what consumers say they want.
Rather than expand consumer options, they will drive patients into restrictive types of HMOs that limit patients to a small roster of doctors.
