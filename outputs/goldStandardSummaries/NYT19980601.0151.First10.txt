Q: I bought four roses in February _ two antique roses and two miniatures _ all of which I grow in containers.
All are blooming off and on, but powdery mildew and spider mites are decimating the leaves and flowers.
I've put fungicides and insecticides on these plants, and nothing fazes these pests.
Leaves that escaped these pests are turning yellow.
I fertilize regularly with rose food.
I water at 6 p.m. as I don't have time to water before work, but take care not to wet the foliage.
A: Thanks to the mild winter and this long stretch of hot, dry weather, spider mites are a huge problem.
These pests are not insects but members of the spider family.
Since you only have four containerized plants, wage war with the water hose.
