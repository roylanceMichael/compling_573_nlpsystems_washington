CHICAGO _ They have never had to fight so long, so hard, and, at times, so futilely, simply to take the next step.
Their warts and blemishes exposed for all the world to see, their swagger reduced at times to juvenile behavior, the world champion Bulls nevertheless have earned the right to defend their title.
They did so Sunday night with a day-at-the-dentist, 88-83 victory over an Indiana Pacers team that probably deserved a better fate.
The NBA Finals open Wednesday night in Salt Lake City and no one who witnessed Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals at the United Center could have not felt that in another time or place, it would have been Larry Bird preparing his team for the Utah Jazz.
``I can't say the best team won,'' said Scottie Pippen in what, for the Bulls, was a rare moment of humility.
For most of this series, they have acted like petulant adolescents when they lost and imperious blackguards when they won.
``I have a lot of respect for Indiana.
They gave us a lot.
I feel both teams deserve to go to the Finals.''
