PHILADELPHIA _ After three months of fruitless negotiations, the city's largest transit union went on strike Monday, shutting down a nexus of buses, trolleys and subways that serves up to 435,000 people a day.
Because negotiations had been going on since March, the city was not caught unawares.
The municipal government and many employers had contingency plans in place for their workers that included private buses, extra cars on the regional railroads that continue to operate and free parking throughout the city.
For those who live in the suburbs, the strike meant somewhat heavier rush-hour traffic, and Mayor Edward Rendell predicted that downtown businesses could suffer.
But the largest burden seemed to fall on working-class people with no cars who rely on public transportation to reach school and work.
Negotiations for a 3-year labor agreement that had proceeded intermittently broke off after a brief session on Sunday with management and union leaders agreeing only that vast differences remained in their bargaining positions.
Certain that no breakthrough was possible, Steven Brookens, president of the Transport Workers Union 234, appeared at a morning news conference to announce that his 5,400 members would walk off their jobs as drivers and maintenance workers at noon.
They did, and three hours later several hundred strikers staged a noisy demonstration at City Hall and briefly blocked traffic in front of management headquarters.
``It's over,'' Brookens said.
