PARIS _ The opera-goers were quiet and serious in the subway.
They'd just exited a riveting production of Alban Berg's ``Lulu,'' a tragic tale of a hooker with a heart of brass, at the Opera Bastille, and they weren't exactly humming the tunes.
At Chatelet station, where the commuter line from the new 80,000-seat Stade de France feeds into the subway system, the train was invaded by a horde of young people dressed in the red, white and blue of Paris-Saint-Germain, the city's pro soccer team.
The pensive silence of the opera-goers was shattered by a lusty chant.
Echoing from one car to the next, billowing in the tiled vaults of the subway stations, it sounded a little like the Tomahawk Chop.
The Paris team had just beaten Lens, 2-1, to win its fifth French Cup.
The team's supporters were ecstatic.
The opera crowd was oblivious.
Some Parisians care passionately for soccer; others, perhaps most, don't.
