NEW YORK _ One juror, an unemployed resident of Red Hook, Brooklyn, said that he believed the death penalty made criminals ``think twice before committing heinous crimes,'' but that he would not automatically vote to execute every killer, because it ``depends on how and why the murder was committed.''
Another juror, a medical technician from Bedford-Stuyvesant said that her first husband had been killed in a 1981 shooting, but that her decision on whether to impose capital punishment in a murder case ``would depend on the evidence presented.''
A third juror, an administrative assistant from Bensonhurst with a doctorate in English literature called her feelings about the death penalty ``sobering,'' saying the ``responsibility for someone's life is an awesome one.''
The three Brooklyn residents are among the 12 jurors who are expected this week to begin determining whether a former jail guard, Darrel K. Harris, will be the first person sentenced to death under the law that reinstated capital punishment in New York State three years ago.
Their statements came from questionnaires they filled out and in replies to questions by the judge and prosecution and defense lawyers during jury selection for Harris' trial.
He was charged with killing three people during a 1996 robbery at an illegal social club in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and on May 19 the jury convicted him of first-degree murder.
Now the seven women and five men on the panel must perform the second task that the 1995 capital punishment law sets out for them: sentencing the 40-year-old Harris to death by lethal injection or to life in prison without parole.
The life sentence is an option if the jurors find it warranted by so-called mitigating factors, which can include positive aspects of Harris' background and character, and his state of mind at the time he committed the killings.
A decade ago Harris was publicly honored as a hero for saving a fellow correction officer during an inmate riot at a Brooklyn jail.
