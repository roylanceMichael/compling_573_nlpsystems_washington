Spend time with Stephen Fry, and one can almost envision what it might have been like in the company of Oscar Wilde.
First, there is his face: the expressive, sad eyes, the fleshy features uninterrupted by sharp angles, the full, pronounced jaw suggesting gentle imprudence.
Even in a green-and-beige jersey with his dark hair trimmed back from Wildean lengths, Fry so resembles Wilde, he could pass for a descendant of the great Irish-born playwright, novelist, and bon vivant.
Still more importantly, there is Fry's wit, a great unbridled thing legendary in his native England, at turns erudite, scatological, provocative, and violently funny.
An accomplished author, like Wilde he is the quintessential dinner guest turning even casual conversation into a brilliant feast to be savored _ rare, filling, and delicious.
Spend time with Stephen Fry, and it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Oscar Wilde, which Fry does magnificently in ``Wilde,'' a new film biography opening Friday.
In many ways, Fry seems born to play Wilde, author of such works as ``The Picture of Dorian Grey'' and ``The Importance of Being Earnest.''
Often hailed as the first true celebrity, a man who relished fame and public adoration, Wilde died in disgrace and poverty after he was convicted of ``gross indecency'' for his then-scandalous affair with a young nobleman, Lord Alfred Douglas.
He died in 1900 at age 46, a few years after completing a two-year sentence.
