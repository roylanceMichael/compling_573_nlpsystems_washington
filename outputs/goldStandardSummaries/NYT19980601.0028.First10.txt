LOS ANGELES _ It was after an NBA playoff game in 1986 that Larry Bird talked about God being disguised as Michael Jordan.
Jordan had just scored 63 points for the Chicago Bulls in a loss to Bird and the rest of the Boston Celtics.
Twelve years later, Bird was back and so was God, this time with nine disciples in tow.
By late Sunday, the crusaders otherwise known as the Chicago Bulls had made believers out of Bird and his Indiana Pacers and anyone who had doubted them.
After turning back the Pacers 88-83 in a stirring seventh and final game in their Eastern Conference finals, the Bulls' claim to a sixth NBA title suddenly doesn't seem the least bit blasphemous.
Like a latter-day Elijah, Jordan predicted the outcome, then made it happen by going out and collecting 28 points, nine rebounds and eight assists.
He couldn't have done it without his teammates, who provided the support that was too often lacking in the first few years of Jordan's ascension.
Make no mistake about it; the Bulls are four wins away from a third straight NBA title because they have not only the best player in the game but one heckuva team.
With apologies to the Utah Jazz, the Bulls' front office may be the only ones capable of stopping these Bulls.
