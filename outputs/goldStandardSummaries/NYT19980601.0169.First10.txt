Jim Carrey has had this strange fantasy going on in his head.
``What if I was the only real person and everyone else was an actor?,'' Carrey says, completely serious.
``And I was some kind of experiment?
``I go to the grocery store, and the guy who, like, accidentally bumps into my shoulder and doesn't say a word.
... Well, that guy, you know, that's a special little part, and he goes around a corner and high-fives a bunch of people.''
Carrey notices he's getting a chuckle, likes it, and begins to laugh himself.
After four years of stardom, he still seems to enjoy entertaining his interviewer, even when he's being serious.
``And then this guy gets on the phone to his agent, and he switches wardrobe because he's got another scene where he just has to drive by me in a car.''
We could dismiss such thoughts as the weird musing of a comic madman.
