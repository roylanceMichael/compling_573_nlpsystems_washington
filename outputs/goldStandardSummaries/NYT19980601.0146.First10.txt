AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General Dan Morales, champion of sound bites and hyperbole, has polished his art on several occasions during the prolonged dispute over legal fees in the tobacco case.
But he outdid even himself last week when he asked a federal judge to slap $25 million in ``bad faith'' penalties on Gov.
George W. Bush and seven legislators who have been fighting to lower the $2.3 billion awarded outside lawyers for representing the state.
Morales, on one side, and the governor and lawmakers on the other, have different opinions of how _ or whether _ the dispute over lawyers' fees will affect Texas' deal to collect $15.3 billion from cigarette makers.
I don't know who is right, and I don't think any of the principals in the debate can be sure either until the dispute is ended, either by the courts or a negotiated agreement.
But Morales has persisted in misrepresenting one important point, and that is that if the controversy were resolved today, tobacco dollars would start flowing immediately to health-care programs for children.
``Right now, there are thousands of children across this state who could have received much-needed medical care had this frivolous action not been pursued by the challengers,'' he said in a written statement.
Morales has made similar statements several times in recent months, but they are not true, thanks to an agreement Morales himself negotiated with key legislators a few weeks after the tobacco settlement was reached.
The Legislature, not the attorney general or anyone else, will decide how the tobacco funds are spent.
