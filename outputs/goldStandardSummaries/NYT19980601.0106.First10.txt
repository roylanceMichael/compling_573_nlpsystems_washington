YONKERS, N.Y. _ Between retrieving thrown juice cups and cleaning up crushed cookies, the moms in the mother-toddler program at the Irish Community Center here talk about home.
But unlike generations of homesick Irish women before them, many of them aren't just talking.
They're going.
With the Irish economy thriving and now an agreement for peace in the long-bloody North _ resoundingly ratified in a referendum last weekend _ the motherland's pull on its exiles in America seems more powerful than ever.
Many young Irish adults are breaking with earlier generations of Irish immigrants who settled in the United States for good: The Irish government reports that over the last two years, 13,000 more Irish moved back to Ireland from America than went the other way.
That reversal breaks with previous decades of Irish immigration to the United States, one of the oldest, largest, most sustained and most culturally influential migration flows of American history _ reaching nearly a million in the 1850s after the Irish potato famine, but dwindling lately to just a few thousand a year.
For a few years now, the Irish have been celebrating the surprising return of their countrymen from England and Australia as well as America, a trend that the peace agreement seems sure to accelerate.
Now the Irish in America, who once saw little choice but to come here, are confronted with a happy dilemma: choosing between this land of opportunity and a land more familiar to them that has been newly vested with promise.
To economists, Ireland is now ``the Celtic tiger.''
