In his delightfully quirky first novel, ``The Mezzanine'' (1988), Nicholson Baker hinted that his love of detail and obsession with minutiae stemmed from his vivid, tactile memories of childhood: ``Will the time ever come,'' he wondered, ``when I am not so completely dependent on thoughts I first had in childhood to furnish the feedstock for my comparisons and analogies and sense of the parallel rhythms of microhistory?
Will I reach a point where there will be a good chance, I mean more than 50-50 chance, that any random idea popping back into the foreground of my consciousness will be an idea that first came to me when I was an adult, rather than one I had repeatedly as a child?''
Given Baker's superawareness of his childhood, it's not surprising that his latest novel, ``The Everlasting Story of Nory,'' should take the form of a 9-year-old's story of ``the absolute best year of her life.''
As usual, Baker focuses his novel on ``little snibbets of the day.''
His first two novels took adult minutiae and extrapolated them into entire books: ``The Mezzanine'' chronicled a man's lunch hour in which he buys a new pair of shoelaces, a cookie and a small container of milk; ``Room Temperature'' described a young father giving his infant daughter a bottle.
``Nory'' deals with similarly momentous issues in the life of a fourth-grader, like the pros and cons of admitting that you like Barbie dolls, the difficulty of getting the right amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush and the problems of lending someone your pencil box at school.
The results of trying to write an entire book about the ``dozens and hundreds of little tiny things'' that happen to a 9-year-old are decidedly mixed.
Although the book once again showcases Baker's gift for microscopically detailed observation, its heroine is so young, so naked of emotional history that her daily routines don't trigger the sort of engaging philosophical musings and stream-of-consciousness reminiscences that fleshed out the grown-up hero's day in ``The Mezzanine.''
Instead, the reader is left with a thin, highly predictable narrative about a schoolgirl's banal _ and uneventful _ life: getting up, getting dressed, going to school, making friends, squabbling with friends, going on outings with parents, going to sleep, having dreams and nightmares, getting up the next day.
