Lillian Ross calls her memoir a love story.
It is also that rare thing, a happy book.
For almost 50 years, she has had the job she wanted: reporting for the New Yorker.
For 40 years, she lived in Manhattan with the man she loved, and who loved her: William Shawn, the magazine's legendary editor.
Shawn called her his wife, since neither liked the word ``mistress.''
It was a commuting marriage, Alec Guinness's ``Captain's Paradise'' but by cab.
Cecille, Shawn's legal wife, lived uptown with the couple's three children, and Ross half a mile away.
This arrangement bothered Ross not a whit: no guilt trip for her, if the wife knew about the arrangement and didn't want a divorce.
``All enduring love between two people,'' she begins her memoir, ``feels intrinsically normal to the couple immersed in it.''
