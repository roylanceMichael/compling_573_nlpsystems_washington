OAKLAND, Calif. _ An empty, wrenching feeling revisited the Raiders this weekend, after the sudden and unexpected death of rookie defensive tackle Leon Bender.
Nearly nine years ago, in the summer of 1989, safety Stacey Toran died in a car accident.
Now owner Al Davis and his team mourn the loss of Bender, the victim of an apparent seizure.
``Al was devastated, like everyone is,'' club executive Bruce Allen said Sunday.
``He had such high hopes for Leon.

He (Davis) just wants to make sure everyone sticks together and helps the family as much as we can.''
