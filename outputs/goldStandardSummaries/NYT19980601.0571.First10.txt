NEW YORK _ Negotiations over New York City's next budget broke down Monday as the City Council prepared for the first time to pass its own spending plan, perhaps as early as Friday, without the agreement of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Council leaders said a breakthrough appeared unlikely because of Giuliani's refusal to consider any changes that council members have sought in his budget proposal unless Peter Vallone, the speaker of the council, abandoned his referendum proposal on Yankee Stadium.
The mayor said that if the council passed its own budget, he would use his broad powers to make deep cuts in programs dear to council members.
After a fruitless 15-minute meeting between the two top negotiators for the mayor and the council early Monday, Giuliani and Vallone held dueling news conferences and, amid much chest-thumping, said they would not budge from their positions.
``Yankee Stadium has absolutely nothing to do with the adoption of this budget, no matter how hard the mayor tries to make it,'' said Vallone, D-Queens.
``Nonexistent,'' Giuliani, a Republican, said when he was asked about budget negotiations.
Clearly relishing the possibility of a fight with the council, the mayor added: ``I've read the City Charter three times now.
So we're ready for them.''
As of last night, no budget meetings between the mayor and the speaker's aides were scheduled for this week, officials involved in the negotiations said, but if history is any guide, both sides could resolve matters at the last minute.
