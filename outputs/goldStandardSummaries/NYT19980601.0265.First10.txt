MESA, Ariz. _ On the surface, the intersection looks like any other in Maricopa County: service station, shopping plaza, a vacant lot prime for development.
Beneath the pizza parlor and gas pumps is another world altogether, one that disappeared half a millennium ago but that still speaks to archeologists in central and southern Arizona.
They happened upon this particular piece of it when the city decided to widen the road, and backhoes turned up yet another village of the prehistoric people known as the Hohokam.
But with Maricopa County growing faster than any other in the country, archeologists fear that Hohokam sites are disappearing daily, before they even have a chance to record their existence.
Concern about sprawl is so great that a volunteer group formed a sort of 911 service _ the South West Archeology Team, or SWAT _ to handle emergency surveys and excavations when a site is threatened.
``Developers see us as the kiss of death,'' said Jerry Howard, curator of archeology at the Mesa Southwest Museum.
``They think we're going to interfere with construction, maybe stop the project, cost them a lot of money.
...
But we can get in and look at the site before the construction crews even get there.''
