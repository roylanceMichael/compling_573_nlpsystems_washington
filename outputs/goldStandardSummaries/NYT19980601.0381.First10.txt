WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich made his second $50,000 payment Monday toward the $300,000 he owes taxpayers in connection with his violation of House ethics rules last year.
Gingrich, who returned from a trip to the Middle East and Europe on Monday, used personal funds, spokesman Andrew Weinstein said.
He is scheduled to pay another $50,000 on Nov. 30.
The final $150,000 is due Jan. 2, 1999, the last day of the 105th Congress.
Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to lend Gingrich $150,000 for the last payment, but Gingrich has yet to decide whether to take the loan, Weinstein said.
The installment plan was the culmination of a lengthy investigation by the House ethics committee into the partisan political role of tax-exempt, not-for-profit organizations with close ties to, or directly controlled by, Gingrich.
Groups that are exempt from taxes may not take part in partisan activities.
With his speakership on the line, Gingrich eventually agreed to admit that he violated ethics rules by providing false and misleading statements to the committee about the involvement of GOPAC, the political action committee he once led, in the development of a college course he taught in Georgia.
He also acknowledged that he should have sought the advice of tax lawyers about the financing of the course, which was widely broadcast, by tax-exempt groups.
