EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The contract impasse between the Giants and linebacker Corey Miller will end Tuesday when Miller signs a restructured deal that calls for a substantial pay cut from the $1.5 million he was scheduled to make next season.
In an effort to trim their payroll, the Giants had considered releasing Miller, who has started 71 games for the team at linebacker, including 14 games last season.
Miller's value dropped this winter when the Giants re-signed linebacker Marcus Buckley.
Coach Jim Fassel and his assistant coaches think Buckley can be the starter at Miller's strongside linebacking position.
Buckley, however, is inexperienced as an every-down player, and the Giants had hoped to keep Miller, who is one of the more senior players on the team.
Until this weekend, Miller had spurned the team's attempts to cut his salary by $600,000 or more.
But with the Giants scanning the waiver wire this week for quality veterans cast aside by other teams in payroll purges, Miller's position with the Giants grew more tenuous.
The two sides came to a contract agreement _ laden with incentives and with a base salary below $1 million _ late Sunday.
After the workout of veteran and rookie players Monday at Giants Stadium, Fassel said he expected the team would soon have an announcement on Miller's status.
