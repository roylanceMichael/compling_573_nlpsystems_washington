Until quite recently titles like Donald Bartlett and James Steele's ``America: What Went Wrong?''
typified commentary about the U.S. economy, and economic journalism was dominated by scare headlines about downsizing.
But now, after a mere two years of good news America's mood has become startlingly triumphalist.
In the view of many business and political leaders America has entered the era of the New Economy, in which traditional limits to economic expansion are no longer relevant.
Because America has a New Economy and the rest of the world does not, it supposedly is once more indisputably No.
1, and the rest of the world must adopt its values and emulate its institutions if it wants to compete.
To anyone with a sense of history, this is deeply worrying.
If pride goeth before a fall, the United States has one heck of a comeuppance in store.
What of our so-called New Economy?
