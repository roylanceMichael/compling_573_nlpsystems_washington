SAN ANTONIO _ Four-year-old Brandon Duke's best buddy is 23 inches tall, with a soft body and a face with a striking resemblance to Brandon's.
And it's not just a coincidence.
One day in January, Brandon's new friend, a My Twinn doll, arrived in the mail.
Since then, he's stuck to his buddy like glue.
My Twinn dolls _ available by catalog from an Englewood, Colo., company called My Twinn _ are designed to look exactly like your child.
They are so lifelike, owners say, the dolls are mistaken for children as they sit on a couch or tag along with their owners in public.
Ellen Duke, a physician in San Antonio, has bought four My Twinn dolls, including one matching what she looked like as a young girl.
The other dolls in the Duke household are twins to Brandon; her oldest son, Eddie; and her stepdaughter, Christina.
``I wanted their kids to see how cute they were when they were little,'' Duke said.
