DETROIT _ Do not ask for whom Martin LaPointe's bells toll, Dallas Stars.
Unfortunately, they still ring for thee.
That's why he is smiling through the pain.
Two sounds pealed through ``The Joe,'' Sunday afternoon, each in its own way chiming a death knell for the Stars.
``Ding!''
The first came in the opening moments of the game, when the Stars' Mike Modano broke free to the right of the Wings' net, silencing the early bedlam of a jam-packed Joe Louis Arena for a frozen moment as he sent a laser shot streaking toward the goal.
The angle wasn't perfect, but it was good enough, and Modano had Wings' goalie Chris Osgood dead to rights.
Osgood never saw the screamer, but he heard it.
Everyone from Motor City to west Texas heard it as it whistled past Osgood's right elbow and clanged off the inside of the far left post.
