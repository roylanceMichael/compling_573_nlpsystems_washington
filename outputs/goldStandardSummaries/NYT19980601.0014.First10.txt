BOSTON _ Raging winds, hail, and blinding thunderstorms pummeled much of Massachusetts Sunday night, killing two people in a pickup truck in Winchendon, Mass., cutting power lines, toppling tree limbs, and threatening tornadoes for much of the night.
With tornado watches in effect throughout the region at least until early Monday, Doppler radar showed a twister may have touched down in Worcester County Sunday night, the National Weather Service reported.
Meteorologists could not confirm a tornado until ground damage could be assessed.
Earlier, a funnel cloud was spotted in Pittsfield, according to Weather Services Corp. in Lexington, but there were no reports that it had touched down.
The storm swept eastward from New York state, but spared New England much of the devastation it had wrought there.
Trees blew through homes and houses were leveled in Mechanicville, N.Y., north of Albany, authorities reported.
But the storm was furious in its wrath here as well: Golf-ball-sized hail tumbled from the sky above Walpole, N.H., leaving cars dented, said Marc Bennett, a Weather Services Corp. meteorologist.
In Lawrence, Mass., almost two-tenths of an inch of rain fell in seven minutes _ a phenomenal amount of water, Bennett said.
And Worcester Airport recorded a 94 m.p.h.
