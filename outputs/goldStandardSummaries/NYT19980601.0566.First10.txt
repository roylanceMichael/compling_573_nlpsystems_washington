SEOUL, South Korea _ In an effort to ease half a century of enmities on the Korean Peninsula, President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea called on Monday for the United States and other Western countries to end sanctions against North Korea and to show greater flexibility in dealing with it.
Kim said that when he makes a state visit to Washington next week, which will include an address to a joint session of Congress, he will urge the United States to give up its economic sanctions against North Korea.
He will suggest, instead, a policy of increasing political ``engagement'' and growing economic ties as the best way to moderate the behavior of North Korea, the world's last Stalinist state.
While Western policies are not expected to change overnight, the pressures for a policy of greater engagement with the North have already been building, and Kim's arguments are sure to carry enormous weight in Washington and Tokyo.
In an hourlong interview Monday in Blue House, the presidential mansion, Kim emphasized that he had no illusions about the North, which even in recent years has sent armed infiltrators into South Korea and continues to aim a vast array of artillery at Seoul.
But he also suggested that it is time to try a new approach to reduce the tensions and the risk of war.
``It would be desirable for the United States to ease its economic sanctions on North Korea,'' Kim said.
``I think this would be more effective in efforts to get North Korea to open up and liberalize.''
Under the Trading With the Enemy Act, U.S. companies are basically banned from doing any business in or with North Korea.
