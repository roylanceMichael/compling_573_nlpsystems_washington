NEW YORK _ Mo Vaughn snapped.
After watching his team nearly blow an 11-0 lead, and wind up facing the tying run at the plate in the bottom of the seventh Sunday, the big guy couldn't take any more.
When the inning was over, he came off the field and tore into his teammates.
It was a first-class, five-star, Jack Nicholson nutty.
It will go down as the water-cooler-flyin', F-bombs-flyin', dugout-roof-shakin', don't-be-jakin', buns-toastin', rump-roastin', Mo Vaughn Slam.
Mo wasn't Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.
No.
Not at all.
The tirade turned things around for the Red Sox.
