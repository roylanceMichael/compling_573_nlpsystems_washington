The Los Angeles Dodgers Monday abruptly ended their relationship with Hideo Nomo, the Japanese right-hander who helped revitalize interest in major-league baseball in 1995 with his corkscrew delivery, but this year had pitched terribly, grew disenchanted and requested a trade.
The Mets expressed interest in obtaining Nomo, while the Yankees said they might also be interested in the 29-year-old right-hander, who was designated for assignment and removed from Los Angeles' 40-man roster.
Nomo, who was 2-7 with a 5.05 earned run average this season, was perturbed that the Dodgers had included him in trade discussions with Seattle about Randy Johnson and asked to be relocated.
``We'll be talking to many teams, perhaps all teams,'' Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, said.
``There is a time frame.
That being said, there is also a great demand for pitching.''
The Mets, who have the lowest ERA in the major leagues, could be very involved in pursuing Nomo, who must be traded or assigned in 10 days or could be placed on unconditional waiver release in seven days.
Nomo is in the last year of a contract that pays him $2.8 million this year.
After having his four-year major-league career take a drastic turn, Nomo might feel cozy with the Mets because Bobby Valentine managed him in Japan, pitcher Masato Yoshii is his best friend, Mike Piazza is his former catcher and Dave Wallace, a senior adviser for the Mets, was Nomo's coach with the Dodgers.
