LOS ANGELES _ This isn't the time for manager Jack McKeon to pull a Mount St. Helen's.
Blowing his top isn't going to right what's wrong with the Cincinnati Reds.
First of all, what you're seeing is what you'll get.
This is not a championship team.
This is not a .500 team.
Nobody promised a rose garden.
Too many weeds.
What you're getting is what $21 million will buy.
It gets you ten defeats in 13 games.
