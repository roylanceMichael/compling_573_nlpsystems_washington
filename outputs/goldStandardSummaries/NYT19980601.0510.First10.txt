NEW YORK _ John Stafford, chief executive of American Home Products, and Robert Shapiro, his counterpart at Monsanto, emphasized on Monday that the $34.4 billion stock-for-stock deal they had just constructed was a merger of equals.
But as is almost always the case in life, one player in this high-stakes game is more equal than the other.
After the merger, the men say they will be co-chief executives with equal footing.
But thanks to Shapiro's unusual executive compensation plan, the deal will put him several rungs above Stafford on the windfall profit ladder.
Not that either executive is going to the poorhouse anytime soon.
After all, Stafford was paid $6.4 million last year in total compensation; Shapiro pulled in $3.6 million.
But the real payday comes when stock options held by the executives are exercised.
Because the deal is a merger of equals and not an acquisition of one company by another, compensation experts say it is a near certainty that any options held by the chiefs will automatically be exercisable when the merger is completed.
This makes for several ironies.
