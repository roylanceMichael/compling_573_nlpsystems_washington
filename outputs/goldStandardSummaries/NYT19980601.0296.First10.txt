WASHINGTON _ California, a bellwether for the nation on issues such as affirmative action and property taxes, is about to make an assault on bilingual education.
California voters are expected to approve a ballot initiative Tuesday that would effectively dismantle the state's bilingual program.
Polls have consistently shown strong support for the proposal among both Anglos and Hispanics.
A Los Angeles Times poll conducted May 16-20 found that 63 percent of likely voters favor the initiative.
While passage of the referendum would almost certainly draw legal challenges from the federal government and groups in California, conservatives in Congress are counting on a big vote against bilingual education to boost their efforts to end federal support for bilingual programs.
``The political momentum is going our way,'' said Jim Boulet Jr., executive director of English First.
``Parents have been demanding English for their children.
Now the politicians are catching up.''
Although bilingual programs vary widely from school to school, their general aim is to help students with limited English by offering instruction in the students' native language.
