The Oakland branch of the NAACP, meanwhile, seems to be stuck somewhere in the late 1980s, with one secondhand computer which doesn't have e-mail and sometimes simply refuses to open files.
``If there's a fairy godmother or godfather out there who can help us with technology, please tell us,'' pleaded Velma Chavis, a volunteer and secretary for the Oakland group.
For years, most California nonprofits have had more in common with the Oakland NAACP than the Mission Y _ cash-strapped, relying on antiquated, donated computers and unsure whether or how to spend precious resources on technology.
But that is slowly changing.
``People in nonprofits are becoming willing to ask the harder questions and do longer-range thinking about technology,'' said Daniel Ben-Horin, executive director of CompuMentor, a San Francisco group that helps nonprofits take advantage of computers.
``We are on the cusp of a turnaround where in the next two or three years, we'll see nonprofits up there using technology like everyone else,'' said Florence Green, executive director of the 1,800-member California Association of Nonprofits.
California's 45,000 nonprofits, with combined revenues of $60 billion, include a wide range of groups _ everything from giant health care organizations like Kaiser Permanente to tiny neighborhood associations.
The state's smaller nonprofits share many technology dilemmas with small for-profit businesses.
When cash flow barely covers the rent, how can anyone afford to invest in computers?
