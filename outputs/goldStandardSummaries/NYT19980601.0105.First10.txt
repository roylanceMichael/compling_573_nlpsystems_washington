WASHINGTON _ ON their northern border, high in the Himalayas, India and Pakistan have for years been fighting for position and not much else along a glacier that is virtually uninhabitable.
On mountains reaching 20,000 feet, their armies snipe and trade artillery blasts, if the weather allows.
By most definitions, it is war, but a small war.
Each side loses as many soldiers to altitude sickness as to combat.
Last week's nuclear tests by Pakistan _ coming two weeks after India's own tests _ have abruptly and fundamentally changed the confrontation between India and Pakistan, which had become a limited, relatively low-intensity military standoff.
Although both countries have had covert nuclear programs for decades, the tests brought both much closer to actually putting nuclear weapons in their arsenals and, worse, on the potential battlefields along their hotly disputed border.
That is why arms-control experts say the truly alarming thing that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government announced on Thursday was not that Pakistan had successfully conducted its own tests.
Rather it was the declaration that Pakistan was already fitting nuclear warheads on top of a missile, tested only last month, that is capable of striking most of India.
Michael Krepon, the president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, an independent research institute here, said the development of nuclear weapons progressed in clear stages: from research to design to tests to the making of the bombs or warheads themselves.
