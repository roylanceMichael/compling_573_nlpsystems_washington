Biography and historical context inevitably shape the way listeners understand a composer's music, and in the case of Dmitri Shostakovich, those details are freighted with the nightmarish interaction between the composer and the Soviet state.
It's hard to imagine, though, that even a listener entirely unaware of Shostakovich's story could listen to his major works _ the symphonies, quartets and operas _ and not get a sense of what he was about.
It may be a confusing sense, actually: Works seeming to glorify the state mingle with works of bitterness and intensity that seem mainly to evoke struggle and protest.
It can seem, in fact, as if bitterness was his driving force.
But Shostakovich also had a lighter side.
Dmitri Kitaenko, conducting the Frankfurt Radio-Sinfonie Orchestra, offers four suites that are as cloud-free as anything Shostakovich composed (RCA 09026-68304-2).
Two of them, the Ballet Suites, Nos.
1 and 3, are compilations of dances from Shostakovich's early ballets and movements from his incidental music for the theater, cobbled together by Lev Atovmyan to help raise money for Shostakovich after he was denounced as a formalist in 1948.
As such, the suites are meant to entertain rather than challenge, and they do so cheerily by way of lilting waltzes and vibrant galops, all orchestrated with the same vitality one hears in the more serious works.
