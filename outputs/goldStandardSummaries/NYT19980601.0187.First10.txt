At the turn of the century, with the economy booming and inequality on the rise, the Salvation Army threw a dinner party at Madison Square Garden.
The stadium's lights beamed down on thousands of poor people tucking into free food.
The rich hired boxes and galleries to savor their philanthropy.
Everybody sang ``Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow.''
It was hailed by the Salvation Army Commander as ``the dawning of a new era, the bridging of a gulf between the rich and poor.''
Over the next quarter-century the masses at the trestle tables turned on the elite in the galleries.
The icons of American capitalism _ the Rockefellers, Morgans and Vanderbilts _ were denounced as ``robber barons'' and ``malefactors of great wealth.''
Antitrust policy was used to cut them down to size, higher taxes to narrow the inequalities they had created, and tariffs to stop them exporting American jobs.
The stock market crash of 1929 (also their fault) led the government to interfere even more in business.
