WASHINGTON _ Plain talk in the federal bureaucracy?
It may never happen, but the administration said Monday it's going to try.
President Clinton ordered all executive departments and agencies to issue documents in clear English and avoid wordy technical jargon that often confuses the public.
``By using plain language, we send a clear message about what the government is doing, what it requires and what services it offers,'' Clinton said in a memorandum to executive department heads.
The memo said that by this October simple language should be used in all new federal documents including letters, forms, notices and instructions distributed to the public.
The order also said documents created before October should be rewritten by January 2002.
In announcing the write-clearly directive, the administration's latest initiative in its ``reinventing government'' effort, Vice President Al Gore said, ``Clarity helps advance understanding, and understanding can help advance trust.
The point is to make sure the American people understand us.''
He said that ``the language in some of these forms is like gobbledygook.
