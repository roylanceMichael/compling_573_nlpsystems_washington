DETROIT _ With just a shade of curiosity in his mind after Friday's 5-3 Stars' loss to the Detroit Red Wings, coach Ken Hitchcock skated up to defenseman Craig Ludwig at practice yesterday and asked to check the team's pulse.
``I told him that after the team meal, 10 or 12 of us were sitting around and the feeling is that, yes, we can beat these guys,'' Ludwig said.
``And I think a lot of it came from that game (Friday) night.
Even though we lost, we gained a lot of confidence from what we were able to do against them.''
The Stars will need that confidence heading into Game 4 today on the same Joe Louis Arena ice where they are carrying a 1-15-2 record in their past 18 appearances.
And with the Wings holding a 2-1 edge in the best-of-seven Western Conference finals, the Stars realize that they are in a dire situation once again _ in jeopardy of falling behind 3-1.
``It's a lot like Game 2,'' Hitchcock said.
``We're not in an elimination situation, but a loss would make it very tough.''
Still, the Stars' coach said he believes that the team is halfway toward a victory, overcoming the key mental hurdle he perceived was blocking the players in their battle with the defending Stanley Cup champions.
