NEW YORK _ Dominick Corso, a New York Civil Court judge and former city councilman, died May 23.
He was 90 and lived in Brooklyn.
Corso won election to the city council in 1960 and served on it for nine years, representing the Bushwick-East New York district.
Among his responsibilities was serving as head of the committee that oversaw the city's anti-poverty programs.
He was chairman of a committee that fought, without success, to create a review board of City Council members to investigate reports of police brutality; the Police Department and Patrolmen's Benevolent Association opposed the idea.
In 1969, he was appointed to fill an opening on the bench of the New York City Civil Court by Mayor John Lindsay and later that year was elected to a 10-year term after being nominated by both the Democratic and Republican parties.
Dominick Corso was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 6, 1907.
He began pre-law studies at St. John's Pre-Law School and graduated from St. John's University in 1931.
He is survived by his wife, Lillian; two sons, Anthony of McLean, Va., and Robert of Staten Island; a daughter, Carol Ann Canapari of Glastonbury, Conn., and four grandchildren.
