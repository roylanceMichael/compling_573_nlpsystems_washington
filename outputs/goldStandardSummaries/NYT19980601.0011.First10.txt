PORT CHESTER, N.Y. _ Compared with small boxing events in other parts of the country, the fights held here in April at the Capitol Theater looked like a police officers' convention.
Clumps of men in sport coats with badges and New York State Athletic Commission emblems guarded the dressing-room doors.
Corner inspectors in surgical gloves leaned over the ropes to monitor the fighters and their trainers between rounds, and were rotated at the bell, with a new inspection team for each bout.
That level of regulatory presence would be unthinkable in many states.
But whether it is zealous, invaluable attention to fighter safety or wasteful extravagance is a question central to the debate about what New York taxpayers get for their money in boxing regulation.
Over the years, the state athletic commission has been criticized as a political patronage operation.
Some boxing experts have recently questioned the credentials of the commission's doctors.
``The commission has always been a dumping ground,'' said one former senior New York boxing regulator, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Still, when compared with other states, New York clearly requires more medical screening of fighters and operates with a budget that dwarfs those elsewhere.
