It's picking exactly the wrong battles with exactly the wrong people, realizing that winning is secondary to dogged persistence and a display of arrogance that both infuriates and disables his adversaries.

_ Eugene Rivers.
It also doesn't hurt the Reverend Rivers to have his painfully earnest mug plastered on the front of the June 1 issue of Newsweek.
