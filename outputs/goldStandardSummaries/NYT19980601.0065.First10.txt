CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico _ There are no fire hydrants in this village on the edge of the rainforest.
There are also no telephones and no electricity.
Miles of twisting, unpaved mountain roads separate the town from the nearest city.
If the 55 families who live here lose control of the annual fires they light to burn away the stubble of last year's crop, they have no way to quickly notify anyone.
They are largely on their own.
Thousands of tiny communities like this are scattered across the state of Chiapas, places where families grow maize and coffee and graze cattle on steep hillsides, using ancient slash-and-burn methods to prepare the soil for planting or to coax grasses out of the ground.
The vast majority of the people have neither tractors nor plows to till the soil.
Women and children walk along the dirt roads, carrying bundles of firewood on their backs supported by straps stretched across their foreheads.
In the mountains around them, plumes of white smoke rise lazily in the midday heat.
