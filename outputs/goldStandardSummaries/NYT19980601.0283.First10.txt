One of the most appealing aspects of the Web is getting something for nothing, not counting connection fees.
One short-term no-cost offering is Outlook 98, the latest version of Microsoft's ambitious calendar, E-mail and address book package.
The software (not to be confused with the very different E-mail-only Outlook Express program that comes with Internet Explorer) is available free for the downloading at www.microsoft.com/outlook/ until June 30; a CD-ROM can be ordered for $9.95.
On July 1, the official price goes up to $109 except for registered users of Office 97, Outlook 97 or Exchange Server.
Something for nothing often ends up incurring subtle costs.
First surprise: If you already have Microsoft Office 97, you may first need to install the Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch, also known as SR-1.
This is a collection of repairs for several unfortunate gaffes, including the one in Word 97 that refused to save files correctly in the prior Word format despite what the program claimed on the screen.
SR-1 also repairs one of my all-time favorite demonstrations of Microsoft's emphasis on quality, the Outlook calendar that put Thanksgiving on various Tuesdays and Wednesdays over the next few years, but never on Thursday, not even in the year 2000.
Since the SR-1 fixes must be in place before you can use a forthcoming SR-2 patch, which includes another hunk of code that repairs potential errors in Excel's spreadsheets, installing SR-1 is a good idea.
