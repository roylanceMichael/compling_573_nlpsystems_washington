With its brassy boardwalk, bar and shopping-mall culture, New Jersey is the ancestral home of the attitudinal T-shirt _ the ones that say things like ``I'm Not as Think as You Drunk I Am'' in blurry letters.
Little surprise, then, that Gov.
Christie Whitman chose to proclaim her state's border victory over New York last week by gleefully displaying a T-shirt that said, ``Ellis Island, N.J.''    The governor was celebrating a triumph in a once-obscure dispute between New Jersey and New York over boundaries in the middle of the Hudson River.
In a 6-to-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that 24.2 acres of Ellis Island landfill were actually in New Jersey, and not in New York as everyone had assumed since the island was expanded starting in the late 19th century to process the arrival of 12 million immigrants.
The original 3.3 acres _ on which the main hall and immigration museum stand _ remain in New York.
No matter which state map it is on, Ellis Island is a national park, owned by the federal government.
Each year 1.6 million tourists visit it.
Last week, reporters dispatched to the island to get reaction to the border victory found a wall of people who might as well have been wearing those T-shirts that say, ``Whatever.''
In short, the public seemed to care little about state sovereignty over the revered pile of land (and landfill) with the breathtaking views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline _ the place where the ancestors of an estimated 40 percent of today's Americans first set foot in the New World.
