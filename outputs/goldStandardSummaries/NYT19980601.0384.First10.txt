ALBANY, N.Y. _ When it comes to baseball lore, Babe Ruth's presence has loomed so large that he might just as well be one of the gods on Mount Olympus.
That has made the accomplishments of Mark McGwire in recent years all the more astonishing.
It can now be argued the veteran player has been hitting home runs farther, and more frequently, than anyone who has come before him, the Babe included.
Indeed, it sounds like heresy to say it, but the St. Louis Cardinals slugger may actually be hitting more home runs of Ruthian proportions that the almighty Ruth himself.
In a culture where casually tossed around terms like ``superstar'' and even ``star'' have lost much of their meeting, both in sports and entertainment, McGwire is metamorphosing before our eyes into a living, breathing baseball immortal.
For a public constantly retrofitting the present with a wistful glance back to the past, he's the real thing in present time.
Take McGwire's latest home-run tear: From May 12 to May 24, he launched seven home runs that rocketed out of ballparks at distances estimated between 440 and 545 feet, with five traveling more than 470 feet.
Those statistics are simply staggering.
No stranger to tape-measure home runs, McGwire last year deposited a pitch delivered by fireballer Randy Johnson some 538 feet from home plate, and tagged another months later that went 517 feet.
