LOS ANGELES _ The most striking thing about the primary election campaigns here, from the candidates' debate to the deluge of 30-second television commercials and the speeches on the stump, was that the topic that dominated California politics for years rarely surfaced: the economy.
While Californians are savoring economic good times, the adjustment has been troublesome for many politicians who are struggling for something to talk about in the absence of ready-made, bread-and-butter issues that touch the lives of voters.
The challenge for candidates, here and around the country, is to adjust to an electorate that has been remarkably transformed _ and become unusually sedate.
Whatever the outcome in this state's primary on Tuesday, the campaign here offers the first big snapshot of how candidates everywhere are trying to navigate the politics of prosperity.
With pocketbook appeals largely off the table, the issue of education _ which was entirely neglected four years ago _ came to the fore, not only in a ballot initiative that would essentially eliminate bilingual education, but also in a broader debate over how to improve California's public schools.
Other close-to-home issues are also bubbling, like growth management and cutting the state's vehicle licensing tax.
And the void is also being filled by personal attacks.
``It's a world of difference in terms of voter attitudes this year,'' said Mark Baldassare, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.
In the San Francisco area, for instance, Baldassare said his polling shows that voters are ``most satisfied'' with their jobs and ``most negative about traffic.''
