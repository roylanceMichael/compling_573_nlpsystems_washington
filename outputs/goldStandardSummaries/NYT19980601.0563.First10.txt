Looking for Laughs in the Right Places    NEW YORK _ Jackie Mason was clutching a microphone and addressing the balding gentleman in the first row, something he has been known to do before.
``Mister, would I ever be so tasteless as to tell a Viagra joke?
Because, mister, I'm not the kind of comedian that would use that lowlife type of material.''
The man laughed, waiting for the inevitable skewering.
He was surrounded by an audience of comedy mavens at Catch a Rising Star on West 28th St., where, unannounced, Mason is performing each evening though Thursday.
It is the first time that Mason has appeared at a comedy club in New York since he played Dangerfield's back in the late 1970s.
``But mister, I want to ask you a Viagra question,'' said Mason.
``Can you answer me this?
What happens when a man like you takes Viagra _ and then the girl changes her mind?''
