ATLANTA _ Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a former Emory University business professor who lost an appointment at the Georgia Institute of Technology after Emory officials accused him of vandalism, has filed a lawsuit charging Emory with trumping up charges against him and sabotaging his career.
In the lawsuit filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Sonnenfeld seeks reappointment to his tenured teaching position and unspecified monetary damages.
An Emory spokeswoman, Nancy Seideman, said the university had not received a copy of the lawsuit and would have no comment.
But in an exchange of letters with Sonnenfeld's lawyer earlier this year, Emory's general counsel, Joseph Crooks, brushed off the professor's claims.
``To the extent that your client's reputation may have been damaged, he is the author of his own misfortune, and further efforts of this type will only make matters worse for him,'' Crooks wrote.
Last September, Georgia Tech said that it had lured Sonnenfeld away from its wealthier crosstown rival to become dean of its Dupree School of Management.
Because Sonnenfeld was considered an academic star who had won acclaim for his teaching and for the creation of an educational institute for chief executives, his appointment was widely seen as a coup for Georgia Tech.
But before the state Board of Regents could approve the $200,000-a-year appointment, Emory officials informed their Georgia Tech counterparts that a security camera at Emory's Goizueta School of Business had captured Sonnenfeld defacing a wall as he walked down a hallway on Nov. 26.
When confronted by campus police about the incident, Sonnenfeld resigned from Emory on Dec. 1.
