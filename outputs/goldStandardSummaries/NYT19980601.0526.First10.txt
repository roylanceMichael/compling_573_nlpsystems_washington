The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 2:    Michael Jordan had just enough energy left on Sunday night to forklift the Chicago Bulls into yet another National Basketball Association final.
That seemed fitting, since it is hard to imagine a final without Jordan.
It is even harder to imagine rooting against him in his twilight years, but the seditious thought occurs that there may actually be more people pulling for his opponents, the Utah Jazz, an admirable and workmanlike team that lost to the Bulls in the final round last year.
The Bulls have Jordan and the great Scottie Pippen, himself no spring chicken, and each has five championship rings.
The Jazz also come equipped with a couple of elderly all-stars, Karl ``The Mailman'' Malone and John Stockton, but unlike Michael and Scottie, these two have never won a championship.
In terms of public sentiment, Stockton and Malone are thus in much the same position as John Elway was in January.
The Denver quarterback, nearing the end of an otherwise brilliant career, had never won a Super Bowl.
When he finally prevailed against a favored Green Bay team, there was a universal feeling that justice had been served.
Whatever the outcome, this should be an interesting series to watch, not least because the four future Hall of Famers who will give the series its emotional content are also disciplined playmakers of the old school.
