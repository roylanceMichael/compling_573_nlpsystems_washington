(Undated) - I love the song ``I Got You,'' by Split Enz.
Tuneful, catchy, biting lyrics _ I've thought it a classic since it was released in 1980.
The trouble is, I'm afraid I'm going to get sick of it.
How, you may ask, is it possible to become tired of a song in 1998 that came out    18 years before?
Because I live in Phoenix, Arizona, the Valley of the Sun and the home of retread rock radio.
I'm no wide-eyed naif.
I know that mainstream radio isn't where I'm likely to discover new rock songs.
The days of adventuro us, college-radio-style free-form programming, when you could hear a Let's Active song, followed by a Throbbing Gristle tune, topped off with a Mission of Burma ditty (``That's When I Reach for My Revolver,'' preferably), are long gone.
Bu t I heard ``I Got You'' five times in one week not long ago.
