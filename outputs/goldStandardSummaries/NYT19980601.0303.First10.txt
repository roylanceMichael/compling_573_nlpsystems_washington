DUBLIN _ Kathleen M. O'Toole, the Massachusetts secretary of public safety, is one of five people expected to be named this week to a commission that will recommend reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force.
The six-member commission, which was established under the accord that was overwhelmingly approved by voters in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic May 22, will be chaired by Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong.
Restructuring of the force of almost 13,000 is considered essential to cementing the settlement and helping to end 30 years of sustained sectarian and political violence.
In a telephone interview Sunday night, O'Toole said she had been nominated to the commission but had not received confirmation from British officials.
But sources close to the selection process in Belfast said that the Northern Ireland secretary of state, Mo Mowlam, will announce the appointment of O'Toole and four other commission members, possibly as early as Monday.
Patten had been named chairman of the commission last month.
``If I am appointed, I'd be delighted and honored to serve,'' said O'Toole, who announced last week she would leave her state Cabinet position this year to become director of the alumni association at her alma mater, Boston College.
``There's nowhere else in the world where the role of the police is more important right now,'' she said.
``There is a huge opportunity in Northern Ireland, and I'd be thrilled to be in a position to contribute.''
