FOXBOROUGH, Mass.
_ MetroStars defender Alexi Lalas claimed that Sunday's game against the Revolution, his former team, was no different than most.
It was an away game against an Eastern Conference opponent below New York-New Jersey in the standings.
``I had two great years here and the fans came to the stadium and were great to me,'' said Lalas.
``It wasn't an opportunity to get revenge or anything like that.
There's no ill will between me and the organization or Thomas (Rongen) or any of the players.
We're friends on and off the field.''
In fact, Lalas said hello to Rongen, and the Revolution coach said hello back.
``Thomas and I still talk and I value him as a friend and as someone that gives good advice,'' Lalas said after his team's shootout win over the Revolution following a 1-1 regulation tie.
