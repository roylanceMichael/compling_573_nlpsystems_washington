DETROIT _ The broad smile that ran across the face of Red Wings defenseman Jamie Macoun was about the only one visible in the Detroit dressing room after Friday night's game with the Dallas Stars.
Macoun's good feeling was understandable: in the second period he scored what proved to be the winning goal.
But most Red Wings players were far more subdued, calling themselves fortunate to escape with a 5-3 victory after blowing a seemingly untouchable 4-0 lead.
``We were lucky tonight,'' said forward Martin Lapointe, who shattered the Stars' comeback hopes with the fifth Detroit goal.
``We let them back in \Rthe game\S.
It's a lesson: When you go up four-nothing in the playoffs, you can't let up.''
Lapointe said Detroit ``Sat back a little'' after scoring early and often.
``A lot of the adrenaline goes down,'' he added.
On the plus side, ``We never panicked,'' Lapointe said.
