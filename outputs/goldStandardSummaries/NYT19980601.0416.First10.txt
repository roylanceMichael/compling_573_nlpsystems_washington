NEW YORK _ Although most children surely know the story of ``The Sleeping Beauty,'' the great ballet of that title is, at least in its complete form, essentially for grown-ups.
Just as long, rhapsodic speeches in a poetic drama may delight adult ears but make children restless, so the many beautiful solo variations of ``The Sleeping Beauty'' may tax young dancegoers' attention spans.
To please audiences of all ages, American Ballet Theater presented two versions of ``The Sleeping Beauty'' on Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House.
In the evening, when Charles Barker conducted, the production was danced in its entirety by a cast that emphasized its choreographic glories.
With her speedy leaps and turns and her unshakable balances, Nina Ananiashvili was a confident Princess Aurora whose movements possessed such clarity that they shone with diamantine brilliance.
Julio Bocca turned Prince Desire into an ardent hero.
He and Ms. Ananiashvili were in total harmony in a grandly scaled wedding pas de deux that became a dance of triumph.
Julie Kent, a tender Aurora in an earlier performance, looked equally sweet as the Lilac Fairy.
And Martha Butler and Ethan Stiefel offered a buoyant Blue Bird Pas de Deux.
