WASHINGTON _ Of all the strange items in the recently released FBI files on former President John F. Kennedy, one of the strangest is a cloak-and-dagger tale involving former Sen. John Tower of Texas.
On July 29, 1963, Tower telephoned FBI headquarters to report what he called ``a very unusual set of circumstances.''
The rest of the story is spelled out in an FBI memo on file in the National Archives.
About two weeks before Tower went to the FBI, his office received a series of phone calls from a New York man who identified himself as Robert Garden.
Garden said he had information regarding the ``national welfare'' that he wanted to pass on to the Republican senator.
Tower's aides initially rebuffed Garden's overture but finally relented after about a week of repeated phone calls.
The brief conversation persuaded Tower to send administrative assistant H. Edward Munden to meet the mysterious tipster at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
Garden, who identified himself as a private detective, reached into a tan briefcase and pulled out legal documents that he said ``dealt with personal matters'' involving Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy.
``The gist of the matter appeared to concern an affair between the president and a woman and as a result of which the woman became pregnant,'' the FBI summary states.
