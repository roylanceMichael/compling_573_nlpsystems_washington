Television Vision    Q.
My mother says sitting too close to the TV will ruin my eyes.
Is she right?
A.
Not according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
In fact, the academy's public information office says, children can focus up close without eye strain better than adults.
That is because the lens, which changes its focus for nearby and faraway viewing, tends to lose some of its flexibility as people grow older.
Usually, sitting very close to the television set is a habit that children grow out of.
However, the academy says, sitting close to the screen to get a clearer image may be a symptom of uncorrected nearsightedness, and children who persist in doing it should be tested for myopia.
