For all those who doubted that Michael Grant was the heir apparent to the current heavyweight champions, Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, Grant showed his best against Obed Sullivan on Saturday night at the Atlantic City Convention Center.
Grant overcame an early cut over his left eye, took as much punishment as Sullivan could dish out and then prevailed over the former Marine when referee Tony Orlando stopped the bout at 2 minutes 16 seconds of the ninth round.
Grant was ahead on all three judges' cards when the bout was stopped.
He had knocked down Sullivan with a blistering left-right-left combination to the chin at 1:50 of the round, a right hand whistling past Sullivan's head as he was falling back to the canvas.
Grant was so happy with the victory that he raced across the ring, jumped into the air as if he were going to hurdle the top rope and then fell flat on his back.
``I was thinking about jumping over the top rope,'' Grant said.
``I just pulled myself back before I hurt myself.
I didn't want to land on some spectators and take them out.''
Grant's record improved to 27-0 with 20 knockouts and he seems to be on a collision course for a title shot against Lewis or Holyfield.
