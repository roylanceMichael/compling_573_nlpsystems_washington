NEW YORK _ What would a newcomer to Colombian folk dance have learned from the program presented by the Ballet Nacional de Colombia on Friday night at City Center?
Not a great deal if that newcomer understood no more than rudimentary Spanish, since the commentary and single-sheet program information were in Spanish.
But this was an event that was clearly aimed at nostalgic displaced Colombians, though the presentation was supported in part by City Center.
And their delight was eventually infectious, as they sang and clapped along, sighed when a favorite dance was announced, and cheered at the frequent mention of their native land.
The program got off to a late and rocky start.
Ballet Nacional, founded in 1971 by Sonia Osorio, the company's artistic director, choreographer and costume designer, has toured throughout the world.
But a surprising number of onstage and technical mishaps here suggested there had been very little rehearsal time in New York.
By the second half, however, the charming, well-trained dancers were irresistibly in command.
The raucous, lilting music of the live band took off.
