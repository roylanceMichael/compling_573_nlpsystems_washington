UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ This is the first political primary of the 21st century.
Voters in the biggest, gaudiest, wildest state go to the polls Tuesday to select their gubernatorial candidates in the most costly, colorful, and bitter campaign of the year.
By any measure, the California race is the most important political campaign in the country this year.
The state's annual budget is about $75 billion, by far the largest in the nation.
It is the only governor's office in the eight biggest states that the Democrats have a realistic chance of capturing.
And the winner will play a major role in reapportionment in 2002, when California, which has 52 seats in the House, may have as many as 60 _ or almost one-seventh of the entire chamber.
But the California race also is significant because, in the political as well as popular culture, California is the national pacesetter.
What happens here eventually happens everywhere.
``From music to entertainment to the national dress code, almost all trends begin in California _ and politics is no exception,'' said US Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat.
