FORT WORTH, Texas _ For weeks, my friends and I have been talking about it, usually in hushed tones around back tables in restaurants.
We don't want others to overhear us pondering the possibilities of Viagra.
Not that we need it, of course.
Still, for men of a certain age _ 40 to 70 is the commonly accepted range _ the concept of a wonder drug that could restore youthful magic to our sex lives is a source of endless fascination and debate.
``I always thought I was perfectly normal for a man my age,'' says 55-year-old Rich Billings of Arlington.
``But now I hear about Viagra, and I wonder if maybe I might be missing something.''
Sixty-four-year-old John ``Zonk'' Lanzillo of Richardson also ponders whether Viagra might be in his future.
``I don't need it now, but I'm wondering if I might not need it next year,'' he says.
``What the heck does it really do, and where'd it come from in the first place?''
