Background    From 1990, Aid Rose to Highest in Region    Since the end of the Cold War and the waning of civil conflicts elsewhere, Colombia has emerged as the largest recipient of U.S. military assistance in the Western hemisphere.
The aid began to rise in 1990, with the Bush administration's ``Andean strategy,'' a five-year, $2.2 billion plan to try to stop the cocaine plague at its source.
U.S. officials believed that with global security threats shifting after the Soviet Union's demise, soldiers and intelligence agents could find a worthy new adversary in the bosses of Colombia's cocaine trade.
And as such efforts gathered momentum in the early 1990s, they focused largely on the bosses themselves.
The expanding U.S. role also coincided with a turn in the region's oldest guerrilla war.
Starting in 1990, several guerrilla groups agreed finally to lay down their arms.
Some 7,000 more, mostly of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (known by its initials in Spanish as the FARC) and the National Liberation Army, rejected the peace.
Cesar Gaviria, then Colombia's president, attacked the holdouts as ``deranged fanatics who have not read in the newspapers the sorry story of the end of communist totalitarianism.''
Confident that history was on his side, he doubled military spending and increased the size and authority of the armed forces.
