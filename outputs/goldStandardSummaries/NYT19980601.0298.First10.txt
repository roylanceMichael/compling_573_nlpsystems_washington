WASHINGTON _ The real scandal in Washington isn't inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue _ it's outside the front gates.
It's the aesthetic problem of Pennsylvania Avenue itself, where the two blocks in front of the White House are closed off and barricaded by ungainly concrete planters.
It's been three years ago this month that President Clinton ordered the closing after a series of breaches of security at the White House and terrorist incidents around the country.
Planners in Washington and beyond talked about turning the stretch of asphalt into the ``people's boulevard,'' lined with gardens where tourists could linger.
Instead, it's become the barren province of a few fast-moving pedestrians in business &UR;  &LR; suits and teenage rollerbladers in pants that are three sizes too large.
For years, good people with good intentions have bandied about ideas for Pennyslvania Avenue and its neighbor, Lafayette Park.
And yet the area looks more scruffy every year, like a neglected corner of an old warehouse district, not the heart of a city that calls itself the capital of the world.
The Kennedy administration preserved the small brick buildings in front of the White House and came up with a plan to install fountains.
That never happened.
