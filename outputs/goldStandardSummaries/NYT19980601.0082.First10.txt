ATLANTA _ For many people, the most frustrating part of vehicle ownership is getting quality service at a fair price.
Because most of us are not certified automotive technicians, when we talk to our technician about vehicle repairs, it's not unlike trying to feel knowledgeable about dealing in rocket science.
Normally, I feel confident about automotive topics, but a recent experience proved that under some circumstances, I can be just as lost at the repair shop as the next guy.
I own a 1978 crew-cab dual rear wheel pickup truck.
Obviously, it is not new, but it is in excellent shape.
With tender loving care, I don't see why I can't expect to drive it another 217,000 miles.
A few months back, it started to develop a front-end shimmy.
When it started to eat up front tires, I decided it was time to do something about it.
Usually all work is done on my truck by one technician.
