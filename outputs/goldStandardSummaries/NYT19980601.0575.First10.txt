TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov.
Christie Whitman faces growing opposition in the state Legislature over her proposal to raise the gasoline tax by 7 cents a gallon to help finance improvements in transportation and preserve open space.
State Sen. Richard Codey, the Democratic leader, said Monday that the Senate's 16 Democrats would not support the tax increase.
Several top Republicans in the Legislature have also expressed reservations, saying a gasoline tax increase should not be used for open space.
Without bipartisan support, it is unlikely that the governor's proposal will win enough votes to get on the ballot in November.
But Whitman aides said they remained confident that the plan would get legislative approval.
``We believe that achieving funding for transportation projects and finding a stable source of revenue for open space preservation are still achievable,'' said Whitman's press secretary, Jayne O'Connor.
At a news conference Monday afternoon, Codey said he would support a bond referendum in the fall to preserve open space.
In the last 37 years, New Jersey voters have approved nine similar bond referendums, raising $1.39 billion to help protect more than 400,000 acres of farmland and other land from development.
