WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from papers filed Monday in the U.S. Supreme Court by President Clinton in response to a motion on Thursday by the independent counsel for an expedited review of claims made by Clinton that would block the testimony of some of his top aides: &QL;    STATEMENT OF THE CASE:    On May 4, 1998, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (Johnson, C.J.
), granted the relief sought in motions filed by the O.I.C.
[Office of the Independent Counsel) seeking to compel Bruce Lindsey, deputy counsel to the President, and Sidney Blumenthal, assistant to the President, to testify concerning discussions they had had with the President of the United States and with Presidential advisers.
The President had asserted that certain of the communications at issue were covered by the Presidential communications privilege, the Governmental attorney-client privilege, and the attorney work product doctrine.
...
In its motions to compel, the O.I.C.
raised two legal arguments.
First, it contended that, because the communications over which the President had asserted the Presidential communications privilege related to private conduct, the privilege did not apply at all.
Relying on this court's opinion in United States v. Nixon, the District Court rejected that argument.
