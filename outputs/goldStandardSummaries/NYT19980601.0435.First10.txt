&UR; YOKO AND HER SON REMEMBER THE DEAD &LR;    &UR; Yoko Ono &LR;  describes her relationship with  &UR; Linda McCartney  &LR; in the latest issue of Rolling Stone.
``During the Beatles' sessions,'' she writes, ``Linda and I quickly learned that our husbands were not all buddy-buddy.
John and Paul were both talented but very strong-willed people.
There was some tension there.
Linda and I left them alone.
But we didn't go chummy-chummy, wink-wink, `Aren't they silly boys?'
either.
We both stood by our men.
That was how we were.''
