Poor Freud.
Democratized, deified, misunderstood, and finally vilified, he dared to open the Pandora's Box of the unconscious and then encouraged us to spill the contents.
For this courageous transgression he has been the celebrated scapegoat of the human condition ever since, as though he himself were responsible for all the little cruelties of neurosis and the hidden behemoths of the id.
Ah, well.
His spirit is probably safe enough, with a defender like Dr. Morales.
``You want to slice up Freud the Father like a sausage, no?''
he might say to a cowering analysand.
``You feel this patricidal wish of death, and so you visit it upon the man who is trying to save you!
Bah!
