All the brouhaha last week over the dropping of remedial classes at the City University of New York, one of the nation's largest systems, would make many people think that remediation was a multicultural course invented by CUNY professors.
They would be wrong.
In 1995, 78 percent of America's colleges offered such classes, up from 73 percent in 1988.
Although they were most prevalent at public community colleges (96 percent of them offered these courses in 1995), they were common at four-year colleges, too, with 72 percent offering the courses.
Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst at the Department of Education, found that almost half of all college students took at least one class to prepare them for college-level work.
At CUNY last year, 46 percent of students entering four-year colleges failed one or more of the placement examinations in reading, writing and math.
At the California State University System, about half the freshmen need such classes to acclimate them to the rigors of academia.
In the Ivy League, the official line is that there are no remedial courses or underprepared students, but these institutions typically provide help in different guises.
Harvard and Yale, for instance, offer peer tutors and a writing center.
