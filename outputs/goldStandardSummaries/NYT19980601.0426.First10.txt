Nick Zito, who lost Halory Hunter five days before the Preakness with an ankle injury, lost his shot at the Belmont Stakes Monday when an ankle injury forced him to withdraw Silver Launch six days before the final race in the Triple Crown.
The injury to Silver Launch left a prospective field of 11 for the 130th running of the Belmont, not counting Grand Slam, the winner of the Peter Pan Stakes one week ago.
Grand Slam's status is still being evaluated by his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, who has to decide by Thursday morning whether to enter the colt.
Grand Slam, winner of the Belmont Futurity and the Champagne Stakes last fall, was severely cut on the leg during the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and did not run in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness.
But he ran powerfully in the Peter Pan.
Silver Launch's injury was detected Sunday afternoon at Belmont Park when he began favoring his right leg, which seemed to be swollen.
Zito called Dr. Jim Hunt, who took X-rays of both legs, found a chip in the left ankle and reasoned that the right leg was swollen from stress because the colt had been babying his left leg.
``I really think we could have had fun in the race,'' Zito said.
``Maybe not win it, but be up there.''
