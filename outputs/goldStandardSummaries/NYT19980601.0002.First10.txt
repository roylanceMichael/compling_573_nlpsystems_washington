NEW YORK _ When Jack Lin heard his winning bid for a newly minted taxi medallion announced at City Hall last September, he felt a flush of love for his adopted country.
And why not?
As the Taxi and Limousine Commission's chairwoman, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, had stated, ``Aside from being a rock-solid investment for any potential small-business owner or entrepreneur, taxicab medallions are literally a piece of the American dream.''
But Lin's heavily financed $231,791 investment has been looking a little risky since Thursday, when the commission steeply increased insurance requirements and dropped the thresholds at which cabbies can lose their licenses.
With a requirement to set aside another $100,000 for accident victims and even lower suspension thresholds likely to be voted on this month, it could get riskier still.
``The city said how good it is to buy the medallion, how it keeps its value, the price never goes down,'' said Lin, an immigrant from Hong Kong and a New York cabdriver for five years, speaking Sunday along a curb in the West Village.
``But they don't tell you the rules were going to change.''
Of the tens of thousands of taxi and livery drivers and owners having to deal with the commission's new safety regulations, the 5,000 owner-drivers of yellow cabs, who have neither bosses nor workers to cushion the impact of the changes, have been hit the hardest.
And no one is more bitter than the men and women who bought 400 new medallions at auctions in 1996 and 1997 _ except, perhaps, for more recent buyers who paid even more money, up to $250,000 each for pre-existing medallions, only to learn that prices have plunged as much as $50,000 since the new rules were announced.
