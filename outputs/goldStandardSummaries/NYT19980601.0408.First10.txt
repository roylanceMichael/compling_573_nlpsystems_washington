Flush fashion companies have thrown a lot of money at a lot of talented young designers in the last few years, setting them up at the ritzy labels that rule the duty-free shops.
All those beneficent companies are hoping for in return is a dinky little breakthrough like the one Tom Ford had at Gucci.
They would just like the kind of collection that, after it is shown, alters the eye and esthetic of the fashion-buying population, saturates editorial pages and has a look so resonant that even the interior-design market feels its influence.
Editors think it's creative; retailers think it's commercial.
Customers think, ``Finally, those designers aren't dressing me like a'' (choose one or all) ``schoolgirl/prostitute/nun/mom.''
It's no surprise that the companies haven't found their Tom Ford yet.
In fact events seem to have conspired to make Ford the last big breakthrough designer that fashion is destined to have before the end of the millennium.
Which, if true, is very bad news.
The American market, at least, is as loaded as it was in the '80s, but no one seems to be able to find a revolutionary new talent to throw their money at.
