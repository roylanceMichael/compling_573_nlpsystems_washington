BAY HEAD, N.J. _ Residents of this wealthy seaside community reacted Sunday with a mix of sympathy and flippancy as they learned that 22 Chinese immigrants landed here on Saturday night.
``It's so sad,'' said Kim Morris, owner of a fashion boutique that sells Lilly Pulitzer clothes.
``They spend their life savings to get here, they survive weeks on a boat _ not that I approve of illegal aliens, but it's sad.
They thought they were in Chinatown, and here they were running around Bay Head.''
Michelle Hoy said that the immigrants had probably paid thousands of dollars to be smuggled into the United States.
``You know how long it took them to make that money?''
Ms. Hoy said.
Others, speculating that the boat that was carrying the immigrants _ the Oops II _ had made a wrong turn, noted the irony of economically desperate immigrants washing up in the borough of Bay Head, where expensive cars are parked in nearly every driveway.
``It's just perfect,'' Katie Dempsey said.
