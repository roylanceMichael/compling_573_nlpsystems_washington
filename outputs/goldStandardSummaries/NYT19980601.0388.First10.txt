SAN FRANCISCO _ Eric Wynalda grew up in the 1970s in a Southern California town where boys played ball in the streets and parents sent their children into the community to test their mettle.
Yet Eric Wynalda was scared.
As the story goes, Dave and Sue Wynalda's middle child went to the drugstore in Westlake Village with his brother Brandt to buy some candy.
But the slight boy who would become one of the most recognizable names in his sport was unable to make a purchase.
``Brandt (Wynalda's older brother) made his purchase and left the store, but Eric was kind of hanging back,'' Dave Wynalda said.
``Brandt went to see what was going on and Eric whispered in his ear and Brandt made his purchase because Eric was too shy.''
Many years later, Eric Wynalda overcame that shyness on a global stage.
Before an international television audience, before tens of thousands of fans, a long way from the cocoon of Westlake Village, Wynalda was so bold in World Cup '90 in Italy that he threw an elbow and became the first U.S. player ever to get ejected from a World Cup.
``That's what gives people the wrong impression,'' Wynalda said.
