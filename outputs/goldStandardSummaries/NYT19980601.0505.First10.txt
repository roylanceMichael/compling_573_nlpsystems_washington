SPENCER, S.D.
_ There's no explaining the things fate chooses to spare.
The mutilated green shell that used to be the house of 86-year-old Marlys Muters was ankle deep in broken glass and mangled furniture on Monday, but just outside lay one of those musical Mother's Day cards and it was playing ``Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.''
The two-story house of Ward and Gloria Satterlee, the minister and organist at the Nazarene Church, is now an eviscerated mound of splinters and shreds, but somehow sticking out untouched from the pile was a white sheaf of church music, a piece called ``Alleluja!''
And though almost everything in Lucille Mone's house came crashing down around her, sitting serenely on the wall is a framed puzzle of a cool, green Irish countryside and a clock that is still telling time.
Mrs. Mone, a sprightly 89-year-old woman who springs around on a wooden cane, was hoping Monday to salvage one more thing: her husband James' false teeth.
``They were in a cup in the bathroom, and he was in bed and the storm blew him out of bed so bad, he couldn't find the floor and that's when he got hurt,'' said Mrs. Mone, whose husband, 95, was still in the hospital with a broken shoulder and broken ribs.
``They were Omaha teeth.
You can't get them in South Dakota.''
