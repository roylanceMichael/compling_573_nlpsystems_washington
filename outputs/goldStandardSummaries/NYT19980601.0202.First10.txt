LONDON _ Sometimes in science, things do not happen singly, but come along in threes, like buses.
Earlier this week the giant agribusiness company Monsanto announced that it has worked out how to generate cotton that is naturally blue.
Meanwhile, clinical trials with people in Baltimore have shown that a genetically-engineered potato can confer resistance to ``traveller's diarrhea'' caused by varieties of the E.coli bacterium.
And now, in this week's science journal ``Nature,'' a team from the University of Exeter announce that it has finally worked out how plants produce vitamin C _ opening the way, it says, to genetically-engineered versions of the fruit which produce far greater amounts of such useful vitamins.
Biologists are increasingly able to map out the locations of every gene in a plant or bacterium, and they are increasingly sure what each of those genes does, and how they interact.
At the more complex level of the functioning bacterium, plant or _ ultimately _ human being, our knowledge is also advancing in leaps and bounds.
So new applications, such as the three listed above, are becoming almost routine.
Scarcely a day goes by without some announcement from a company involved with genes.
But while gene-jeans may excite casual interest, the real focus is on altering plants so that they will become truly useful ``factories'' for chemicals such as vaccines; or simply making them more fertile, so that the same land area can feed the ever-expanding number of mouths in the world.
