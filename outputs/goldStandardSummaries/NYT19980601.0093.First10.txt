It is not clear that any survey of the population would reveal a deep yearning for another professional football league, but it looks as though we may be getting one anyway.
Aced out of their traditional role in televising NFL games in the last, breathtakingly costly round of bidding for those rights, NBC and Turner broadcasting have announced plans to create a league of their own so as not to deny their viewers the ration of football they have been conditioned to expect.
The two mean to bring some 10 to 12 franchises on line, perhaps as early as the fall of '99.
Previous, similar undertakings flopped.
Remember the World Football League?
Neither does anyone else.
The U.S. Football League was taken off the gridiron in 1996 after failing to sizzle in three years.
The attempt to interest U.S. viewers in the affairs of the Canadian Football League foundered on the thoughtful American conviction that Canadians could not possibly have anything useful to do with football.
NBC and Turner see better prospects for their venture because by owning the teams outright they will be able to keep salaries down, and if that would seem to promise games that are mainly comedies of error -- blooped punts, fumbled passes, half-fast backs -- the same proprietorship also would let the owners script the games for thrills.
