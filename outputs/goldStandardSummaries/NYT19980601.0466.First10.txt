ATLANTA _ Lockheed Martin is vying for a multibillion-dollar project to upgrade the military's C-5 heavy transport jets, a contract that could mean continued stability for Lockheed and its 10,000 workers.
U.S. Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia, speaking Monday at a Cobb County Chamber of Commerce breakfast, said Lockheed is seeking two government contracts to modernize the C-5's electronics and engines.
The Air Force plans to complete the modernization of 126 C-5 jets in two phases.
The first phase would replace the plane's 20-year-old electronic, navigation and communication systems.
That contract, worth $400 million to $500 million, is scheduled to be awarded in September.
Lockheed spokesman Ray Crockett said the company's main competitor is Raytheon of Waco, Texas.
The second phase would replace the C-5 engines at an estimated cost of $4 billion to $5 billion.
Bids are not out yet for the second phase, which is to start in 2002, said Bill Arndt, Lockheed program manager for C-5 modernization.
While the two contracts could mean significant business for Lockheed, they probably won't require additional employees, Crockett said.
