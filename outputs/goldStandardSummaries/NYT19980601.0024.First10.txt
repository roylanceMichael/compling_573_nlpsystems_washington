FOXBOROUGH _ Revolution coach Thomas Rongen continues to preach patience but his team continues to falter.
The Revolution scored a late goal to tie the score, 1-1, against the New York-New Jersey MetroStars Sunday, but lost in the shootout to remain in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 10 points in 11 games.
Even more discouraging for the Revolution is that they have held the lead for only three minutes of the last 450 played.
``In the last few games we haven't been able to take the lead and we have ended up scoring in a desperate fashion,'' Rongen said.
``But we have enough firepower to be able to get the lead and hold onto it.
And this team will show it can win.
``We have scored 19 goals, which is more than previous years.
And, with resilience, we are capable of scoring goals and we are capable of scoring early.''
Last year, the Revolution's Alberto Naveda scored a hat trick in a 3-1 victory over the MetroStars to give them 13 goals in 11 games.
