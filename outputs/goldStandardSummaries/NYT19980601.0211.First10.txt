ROME _ The resignation of President Suharto under intense pressure from popular demonstrations and finally from the military, which holds the keys of power, is a great step forward for Indonesia.
Although it was against his will, Suharto's peaceful departure from power nonetheless crowned decades of great accomplishment.
Although gravely marred by the last 15 years or so of rampant corruption, forcible suppression of opposition and brutal, imperialistic expansion in East Timor, the overall record of Suharto's administration is, nonetheless, admirable.
He and his American-educated technocrats transformed a nation that was literally bankrupt, with people on the verge of mass starvation.
When Suharto stepped down, the people of Indonesia's 13,000-odd islands were generally well off and better educated; they spoke the national language, as well as their own, widely divergent tongues; they no longer groaned under the oppression of the Javanese, the domineering natives of the largest island, and they truly felt themselves citizens of a nation whose motto is ``unity out of diversity.''
For the first time the voice of the people has been decisive.
No transfer of power in the former East Indies' thousands of years of history as an empire or as a congeries of principalities had ever before been determined by the public's wishes.
Certainly no transfer of power in Indonesia's 50 years as a nominal republic had occurred peacefully.
Wits used to say that Indonesia was the most stable nation in Asia, perhaps the entire world _ after all, it had had only two presidents in half a century, Sukarno and Suharto.
