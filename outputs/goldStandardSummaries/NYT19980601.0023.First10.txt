FOXBOROUGH, Mass.
_ The Patriots are raw at running back this season.
Real raw.
In fact, by the time this week's rookie camp and next weekend's full-squad camp end, the team will have looked at nine backs.
Their combined NFL experience?
Seven years.
When rookie camp begins Monday at Foxboro Stadium, the team's coaching staff and management will be hoping that Robert Edwards, Sedrick Shaw, Harold Shaw, Derrick Cullors, Tony Carter, Chris Floyd, Marrio Grier, and two others can make up for the losses of Curtis Martin, Sam Gash, Keith Byars, and Dave Meggett.
Edwards was the team's No.
1 draft pick, the 18th player taken overall.
