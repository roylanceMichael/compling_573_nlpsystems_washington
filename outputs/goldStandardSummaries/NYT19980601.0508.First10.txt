(Undated) - If the Rev.
Fred Phelps is correct _ and by God he believes he is _ then former Sen. Barry Goldwater is now a resident of hell.
Along with Frank Sinatra, Sonny Bono, Princess Diana and, possibly, Mother Teresa.
In order to reinforce this belief, Rev.
Phelps is sending a squad    of holy warriors to picket Goldwater's funeral Wednesday.
They plan to carry signs reading ``Barry in hell'' and worse.
This is necessary, the reverend told me Monday, because Goldwater was ``a supporter of Sodomites.''
He explained , ``When you want to say it's OK to be gay, then you're saying God is a liar and the Bible is not a reliable guide.
You're saying it's OK to sin, because if the Bible is wrong on that weighty matter, then it's not reliable on any matter.''
