NEW YORK _ As the authorities searched for the captain of the smuggling boat that ran aground Saturday night in New Jersey, investigators Monday began to interview its 22 Chinese passengers in the hope of learning who organized and profited from their flight.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service released little information about the detainees Monday, other than that they came from Fujian Province, the starting point for many of the illegal Chinese immigrants who have made the tortuous journey to American shores in recent years.
Officials said that investigators were still conducting separate interviews of the 22 men, the youngest of them 18 and the oldest 45.
The men were being held at the INS detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where they will appear before immigration judges later this week and be charged with illegal entry into the United States.
At that point, usually the beginning of a long and complicated legal battle, they may ask for political asylum.
Speaking at a news conference in Washington, the INS commissioner, Doris Meissner, said the facts that were known about the men's journey, although sketchy, fit into a pattern seen in other immigrant-smuggling cases.
``At this point, we would operate on the supposition that they are connected to an organized-crime organization of some kind,'' she said, calling the Chinese-smuggling business particularly odious because it funnels hapless immigrants into sweatshop jobs where they are abused, exploited and overworked.
``This is a multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise played out on a global scale,'' Mrs. Meissner said.
Investigators were still searching for the captain and presumed owner of the boat, who slipped through police hands before anyone realized that the abandoned craft had unloaded a human cargo of illegal immigrants.
