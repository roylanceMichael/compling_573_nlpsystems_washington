NEW YORK _ Continuing to wind up its season, Broadway sings and dances through ``Stars in the Alley'' Wednesday.
The show is one of the many events of Theater Week, culminating in the 52nd Annual Tony Awards ceremonies on Sunday night.
The 12th annual ``Stars in the Alley'' will bring such performers as Victor Garber of ``Art,'' John Leguizamo of ``Freak,'' Ming-Na Wen of ``Golden Child,'' Douglas Sills, Terrence Mann and Christine Andreas of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and Hinton Battle of ``Chicago'' to Shubert Alley, west of Broadway between 44th and 45th Streets.
Highlights of the event, which begins at 11:30 a.m., include musical performances from the Tony-nominated shows ``Ragtime,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``1776,'' ``The Sound of Music'' and ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.''
Taking the Helm    The Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago has chosen Robert Fitzpatrick, dean of the School of Arts at Columbia University since 1995, as its new director.
Fitzpatrick, 58, oversaw the creation of EuroDisney and was president of the California Institute of the Arts from 1975 to 1987 and the director of the 1984 Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles, which attracted more than a million visitors in its 10-week run.
He is to assume his new duties in September, becoming the sixth director in 31 years at the museum, which moved into a new 151,000-square-foot building two years ago.
Fitzpatrick succeeds Kevin Consey, who resigned in November.
