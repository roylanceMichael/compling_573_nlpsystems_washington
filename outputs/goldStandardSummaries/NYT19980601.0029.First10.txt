&UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ When Puerto Madero took to the track for the Massachusetts Handicap Saturday, John Murphy had the same thought as did many of the 17,754 fans at Suffolk Downs.
Fan after fan thought what Murphy said.
``What a beautiful-looking horse,'' said Murphy, the owner of Formal Gold who lost to Skip Away by a neck in the stirring 1997 MassCap.
``You won't find many who look better than he does.''
And jockey Kent Desormeaux aboard Puerto Madero thought his horse was running as beautifully as he looked as Desormeaux made his move to catch Skip Away on the far turn.
``I thought I really had him,'' said the hottest jockey in the United States.
``I made up 4 lengths on him and I thought I was getting to him.''
But then Skip Away ``hit that next gear,'' as the jockey put it, and Desormeaux learned as so many others have learned, that Skip Away is more, much more, than he looks.
Skip Away jogged away from Desormeaux and Puerto Madero in the stretch drive, leaving the jockey to say, ``I guess we'll have to get him the next time.''
