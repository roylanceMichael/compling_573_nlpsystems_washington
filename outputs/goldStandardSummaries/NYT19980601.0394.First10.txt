(UNDATED) _ During my b irthday party in January, my best friend asked if I'd like to join a group hiking the Grand Canyon in early April.
My friend didn't know that turning 40 had thrown me into a midlife crisis.
I was looking down a corridor that seemed to be getting    shorter by the minute.
What, after all, had I done with my life?
Where had the years gone?
Why am I suddenly getting tasteless birthday cards?
These troubling thoughts coupled with a third beer clouded my reason: ``Yes, I'd very much like to do that,'' I responded.
Hiking the Canyon would force me to get in shape, clear my head, give me a goal.
&QL;   &QL;    My friend had applied to the Park Service for a backpacking/camping permit last year.
