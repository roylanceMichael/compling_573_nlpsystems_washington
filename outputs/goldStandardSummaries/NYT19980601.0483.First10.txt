Guerrillas    Rebels and Traffickers in a `Coca Republic'    Administration officials say there is no sure way to keep the anti-drug battle from running into the guerrillas, given what has taken place over the last couple of years.
In response to an aggressive government campaign against coca cultivation and transportation in neighboring Peru, the officials say, the traffickers have joined some major rebel fronts to create a virtual coca republic.
Peasants who support the insurgents are planting more coca, FARC units are protecting more drug crops and labs, and government authority has eroded across the region.
Military officials including Wilhelm, the commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said drug profits and other income are financing the guerrillas' purchase of more and perhaps more sophisticated communications equipment and weaponry.
Intelligence officials said there was now some guerrilla activity in perhaps 700 of the country's 1,071 municipalities.
And they estimate the insurgents' strength at as many as 18,000 combatants _ 10,000 or 11,000 in the FARC, 7,000 in the National Liberation Army _ up from as few as 8,000 fighters six years ago.
``The threat is intensifying,'' Wilhelm said in an interview.
``We are seeing, basically, an undermining of governance at the grass-roots level.
In a sense, I see a nation divided.''
