``My lips are disappearing,'' a friend says, looking in the mirror.
They don't look any different, to me at least.
Maybe she thinks they're disappearing because she's comparing them to fashion's latest word on lips, i.e., bigger is better.
I switched on the TV the other day just in time to hear a makeup consultant say, ``lips are all over the place this season.''
Since I tuned in late, I'm not exactly sure what he meant by this.
But lips are everywhere these days, or maybe it just seems that way because they're so much bigger than they used to be, so they take up more space.
Thumbing through fashion magazines, one can see page after page of models with huge, puffy, pouting lips.
Sometimes it looks all right, if the lips are in proportion to the rest of the face.
But in some cases the lips dominate every other feature, so that's all you see _ lips.
