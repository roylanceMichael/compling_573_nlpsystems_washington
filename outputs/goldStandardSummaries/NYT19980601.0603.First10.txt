LOS ANGELES _ When Real Quiet's van arrives at Belmont Park in New York on Wednesday, the colt might find as many as 11 opponents and 1{ miles of mud standing between him and thoroughbred history.
At least eight challengers have been lined up, which is more than any the 11 Triple Crown winners faced in their Belmont Stakes victory.
The eagerness of rival owners to take on the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner confirms the obvious, that not everybody sees Real Quiet as a great horse worthy of mention alongside Count Fleet, Citation and Secretariat.
The debate promises to dominate this week leading up to Saturday's Belmont Stakes: Is Real Quiet somehow unworthy of a Triple Crown because of his 4-for-14 record and the fact that injuries to some other top 3 year olds have simplified his task?
Real Quiet is scheduled to put in his last serious, 5-furlong workout this morning at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., and fly and van to Belmont on Wednesday morning along with owner Mike Pegram, trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Kent Desormeaux.
The weather was pleasant on Long Island on Monday.
Thunderstorms are predicted today and Wednesday.
The long-range forecast for Saturday has partial cloudiness and temperatures in the 80s _ but the skies can change quickly on the Atlantic coast.
The weather could be a factor, because Real Quiet ran the worst race of his career on a mucky surface at Golden Gate Fields in Albany, Calif., in January.
