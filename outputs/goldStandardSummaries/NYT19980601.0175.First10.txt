DETROIT _ Martin Lapointe glided into a vacated Dallas Stars zone, behind a vacated Stars net where he passed Stars goalie Ed Belfour, who had ventured from his crease to play the puck.
This much we know.
This much they agree on.
From there, Lapointe either slashed Belfour's leg (Belfour's version) or Belfour took a dive (Lapointe's version).
``Well I played the puck, and Lapointe two-handed me and got me between the pads,'' Belfour said.
``Obviously, it hurt.''
The Stars goalie went down either writhing in pain (Belfour's version) or trying to draw a penalty (Lapointe's version).
``He was trying to draw a penalty, obviously,'' Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman said.
The next point on which everybody agrees is that Belfour scrambled back to the crease.
