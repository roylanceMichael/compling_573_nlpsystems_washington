Given how much time your family spends in the car, you want your vehicle to be as safe as possible.
Lessen the chances of mishap or injury with these safety, maintenance and driving strategies.
&QL;   &UR; -0- &QL;   &UR; CHILD-SAFETY SEATS &LR;  &QL;    All kids, especially those in car seats, are safest riding in the back.
Make sure that your child uses the right safety seat for her age and weight _ a rear-facing seat for infants up to 1 year and 20 pounds, a forward-facing seat for children over 1 year and weighing up to 40 pounds, and a booster seat for kids who are too big for a car seat and too small to fit correctly in a lap/shoulder seat belt.
Some safety seats cannot fit in some cars because of the configuration of their belts or the shape of the seat.
When buying a car seat, be aware that it might not fit your vehicle.
You may need to return it and try another.
Read the safety-seat instructions and your car manual carefully to make sure you install the seat correctly _ as many as half of all safety seats are used improperly.
&UR; TIRES &LR;  &QL;    Some tires are made for speed, some for control and some for bad weather.
