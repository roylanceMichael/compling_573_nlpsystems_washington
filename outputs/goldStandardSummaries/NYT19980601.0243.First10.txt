The best has just gotten better.
It's hard to imagine the king of the sport utilities getting any better than it was, but that's what happened when Toyota redesigned the Land Cruiser for 1998.
This is the vehicle that has set the standard for sport-utilities since the previous generation debuted in 1991, even against such tough and capable competition as the Range Rover and Lincoln Navigator.
But for 1998, Toyota has raised the bar to a level that will be hard for any manufacturer to match, let alone top.
The new Land Cruiser _ which also comes in a Lexus version called the LX 470 _ now has a 4.7-liter, 32-valve, double-overhead-cam V-8 engine replacing the previous generation's inline six.
That engine cranks out 230 horsepower, an increase of 18, and develops 320 foot-pounds of torque, up 45 from last year.
This all-new engine is based on the V-8 used in the Lexus LS 400 sedan, but it's significantly modified to produce better low-speed torque for trailer-towing and off-road hill-climbing.
The Land Cruiser goes from zero to 60 mph in 9.9 seconds, an improvement of two seconds over last year's model.
That's quite impressive for a vehicle that weighs 5,225 pounds empty.
