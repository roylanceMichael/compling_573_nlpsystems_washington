Sean Sullivan paid $1 for a secondhand address book recently, and what an address book it turned out to be.
He bought it at a yard sale in East Hampton at the home of a famous theatrical couple, and he's still mesmerized by his glimpse into another world, and the juxtaposition of the celebrated and the mundane.
There's Dick Cavett, Cy Coleman and Betty Comden next to Cable Vision and the Cleaners, Joseph Heller and Don Hewitt along with the Handyman and Hardware store, and Kurt Vonnegut listed with the Villa sandwich shop.
Why was Lauren Bacall crossed out _ a falling out or a change of phone number?
Why five masseuses?
In fact, why was the address book in the sale anyway?
Talk about getting your money's worth.
On a recent trip to New York, I had occasion to visit the main post office, where I overheard the following:    Customer to postal clerk: ``Do you have any angel stamps?''
Postal Clerk: ``We have books of 20 stamps for $6.40.''
