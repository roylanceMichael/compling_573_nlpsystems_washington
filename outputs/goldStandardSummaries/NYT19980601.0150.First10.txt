All those years of keeping the focus on the music means that people now don't expect any details, juicy or otherwise.
And it's not as if Strait is a total mystery.
We know he grew up in Pearsall; his parents separated when George was young; and he and his older brother, Buddy, were raised by his father, John, a math teacher and part-time rancher.
We know that Strait attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, enlisted in the Army in 1971, and was in for three years, stationed in Hawaii.
That is where he began singing in a band; when he returned to San Marcos (he graduated with a degree in agriculture), he began playing bars, gradually becoming more and more popular.
And we know that Strait signed with MCA in February 1981; his first single for the label, ``Unwound,'' charted in early May, just before he turned 29.
His first LP, ``Strait Country,'' was released that September, and within a few years _ on the strength of songs such as ``Right or Wrong,'' ``Amarillo by Morning'' and ``You Look So Good in Love'' _ he was a major star.
Then, on June 25, 1986, his 13-year-old daughter, Jenifer, was killed in a car accident near San Marcos.
Strait's career has continued to prosper despite changing times; he was named the Country Music Association's Entertainer of the Year in 1989 and 1990 and was named Male Vocalist of the Year four times by the CMA and three times by the Academy of Country Music.
