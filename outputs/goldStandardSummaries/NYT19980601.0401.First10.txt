A fascination with birds, mammals and other animals takes hold in early childhood and, in many of us, never abates.
And there's nothing quite like photographing a wild animal to give you the thrill of the hunt without harming the animal itself.
A wildlife photographer's greatest asset is not equipment nor scientific knowledge, but patience.
Failures, near misses and numbing repetition are as much a part of the experience as any glossy photograph of a bird or beast.
Recognizing the fragility of their subjects, wildlife photographers adhere to a strict code of ethics.
The cardinal rule: If anything you do directly or indirectly endangers, restricts or harasses an animal, stop it and leave.
The integrity of a wildlife photograph vanishes if the subject is not free to come and go, if it shows fear or anxiety, or if it has been provoked to attack or to defend itself.
Beginners must impose upon themselves additional constraints.
Under no circumstances should a novice photograph a bird's or mammal's nest, for example.
