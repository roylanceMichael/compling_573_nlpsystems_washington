HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The Jets lost another key component of the high-profile influx of offense they made two years ago when they released right tackle David Williams on Monday.
Williams, plagued with recurrent back problems that continually interrupted his Jets career, was about to retire, and will most likely do so.
But the release evoked memories of the Jets' failed 1996 attempt to buy an offense.
Williams was one of four highly touted free agents the Jets picked up for $57 million in long-term contracts in 1996: he joined quarterback Neil O'Donnell, left tackle Jumbo Elliott and wide receiver Jeff Graham.
The Jets were widely applauded for these bold moves in their attempt to come back from their 1995 record of 3-13.
But each of the four was injured at some point during the year and the club wound up with a franchise-worst record of 1-15.
The Jets turned themselves around anyway, improving to 9-7 last year in Bill Parcells' first season as the coach, but with less help from Williams.
Now, only Elliott is assured of a starter's role on the Jets next season.
Graham was traded last draft day, while O'Donnell remains unwavering in his demand that he receive his full 1998 salary of $4.2 million.
