NEW YORK _ It won't be long before the inter-league series between the Mets and the Yankees will be billed as a World Series preview.
Who knows?
By that weekend, June 26-28, the Mets may even be in first place.
``Don't count them out; that's the way I look at it,'' the Yankees' Darryl Strawberry said Monday, discussing the Mets' rapid rise in the National League East.
``They're sitting right at the table.
Being five out in June, there's a great opportunity for the window to open up for them to sneak past.
You never know.''
Having slashed Atlanta's lead from nine games to five in the first seven games after The Trade, the Mets have not only raised their position in the NL wild-card race, but also have some dreamers thinking they could be good enough to overtake the perennial champion Braves.
It has indeed been a remarkable 10 days for the other team in town.
