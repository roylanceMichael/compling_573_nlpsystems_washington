INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Mud Route won The Californian on Sunday and lost his claim to fame.
Until he surged to the lead on the turn for home at Hollywood Park and held off Deputy Commander by two lengths, he was the best horse who'd never won a stakes race.
Mud Route, ridden and trained by Hall of Famers Chris McCarron and Ron McAnally, was an early West Coast favorite for the 1997 Kentucky Derby after swift maiden and allowance victories _ but shin problems sidelined him until fall.
At Santa Anita this winter, the colt twice finished second to '97 Derby winner Silver Charm.
His reputation preceded him to Arkansas, where he was favored in the Oaklawn Handicap but ran fourth.
A confidence-building victory against cheaper horses last time out set him up for The Californian, a $250,000 race whose 45 winners include 10 national champions.
Mud Route ($3.80), once a speedball, stalked Worldly Ways for most of the 1[-mile race.
Deputy Commander, trying to find his Travers- and Super Derby-winning form and carrying six pounds more than the field, came wide and finished 2{ lengths in front of third-place Worldly Ways.
``Right now, I'm not sure if he can beat Silver Charm,'' McAnally said of Mud Route, ``but at least he's won a stake.''
