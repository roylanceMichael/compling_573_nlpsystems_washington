SAN FRANCISCO _ The Calypte Biomedical Corp. said Monday that it had received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin marketing its urine test for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
The test is the first complete urine-based diagnostic kit for HIV that does not require confirmation by blood test.
The advantages of a urine test are greater ease of use and lower cost for health care providers, and a safer procedure for patients.
According to the National Institutes of Health, there is no evidence that HIV is spread through urine, thus reducing the chances of accidental infection as a result of needle pricks or the handling of samples.
Like most blood tests, Calypte's urine HIV test and its urine-based confirmation test both detect the presence of antibodies, not the virus itself.
Calypte itself will market the test to life insurance companies, and will join with Seradyn, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi, to sell to hospitals and clinics.
The company must perform additional clinical trials to obtain approval for a home-testing system that would be sold over the counter.
Fred Toney, an analyst with Pacific Growth, said he estimated the market for Calypte's test to be about $300 million annually in the United States.
