Because Ford's vision was so jaded, it was terminal.
Ford has performed like Paul Newman in ``The Hustler.'
He has nearly cleared the table, and left those who follow him in the game not a single clear shot.
How does any designer follow a collection that reads as utterly bored with artifice, when, after all, fashion is only artifice?
Even Ford has found himself in a creative cul-de-sac.
In trying to undo the jaded esthetic that Ford has wrought, some designers have opted for ultra-romantic and ultra-ornamental.
Unfortunately, those tricks are the generic goop of fashion design, owned by no one, used at one time by everyone, but certainly not the basis for anyone's breakthrough.
Young designers who have received the most attention of late _ and youth is relative _ are those who have proven not that they have inventive ideas, but those who have proven they can toe the commercial line.
But the creative lull isn't being caused only by the timid younger generation.
