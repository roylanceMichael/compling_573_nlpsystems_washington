NEW YORK _ Telling jurors who are deciding whether her son should be executed that his fate was really ``in the Lord's hands,'' the mother of a former jail guard recounted Monday how she fell apart when the police told her that her ``special child'' killed three people.
But despite the bloody 1996 rampage that made her son, Darrel Harris, the first person to be convicted of first-degree murder under New York state's new capital punishment law, Bertha Harris declared in a Brooklyn courtroom of rapt jurors and spectators, ``My love for my child has not changed.''
``I love him and I always will love him,'' the 71-year-old woman said as her son, 40, stared at her intently from his seat at the defense table in state supreme court.
``He will always have a special place in my heart, regardless of what happens to him,'' she continued, even as she acknowledged his ``very terrible crime.''
Ms. Harris did not ask the jury to spare her son's life _ the panel may sentence him to death or to life in prison without possibility of parole _ saying instead: ``I don't know what decision you all are making.
That's not in my hands.
It's in the Lord's hands.''
But her son's lawyers clearly hope that Ms. Harris' appearance _ and her portrayal of him as a devoted son who a decade ago made her proud when he was honored for saving the life of a fellow jail guard during an inmate riot _ would help influence the jury to forgo a death sentence.
Deliberations are to begin Tuesday.
