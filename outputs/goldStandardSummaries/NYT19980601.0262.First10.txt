WASHINGTON _ For four years, House members backing an overhaul of the nation's campaign finance system struggled to build a majority to pass the measure.
Last week, they said they had reached their goal, securing the 218 votes needed for a simple majority in the 435-member House.
But now House Republican leaders have changed the rules, demonstrating that nothing is likely to be simple in the campaign to get big money out of politics.
Faced with newly crafted House procedures for considering the campaign finance issue _ rules the House parliamentarian described as ``unheard of'' in recent history _ advocates for overhauling the system began waging a grass-roots effort last week to persuade dozens of additional House members to form a super majority they may need to overcome the obstacle.
The rules, which have sent confused lawmakers scurrying to House parliamentarian Charles Johnson for guidance, effectively create a legislative free-for-all among every coalition trying to improve the campaign finance system.
Debate on the issue, which began May 21, is set to resume this week, after House members return from their weeklong Memorial Day recess, &UR;  &LR; and continue into the summer.
``The Republican leaders have set up a system to divide and conquer,'' said Lloyd Leonard, spokesman for the League of Women Voters, which favors major changes in the system.
``We need to unite all our forces against them.''
If the standard House rules applied, supporters of a bill sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, said they would have enough votes to pass the overhaul measure and send it to the Senate.
