NEW YORK _ Winning is everything to Pedro Martinez, that's the bottom line.
But despite being the winning pitcher in a 13-7 decision over the Yankees before a crowd of 55,711 Sunday, Martinez left in the sixth when he lost a chunk of an 11-0 lead.
He was happy that the Red Sox held on, but after the game he lashed out at the umpiring crew he believes made his early exit necessary.
In his 5 2/3 innings, Martinez threw 130 pitches, 84 of which were deemed strikes.
But Martinez believes he threw many more strikes than that but was not getting the calls from plate umpire Jim Joyce, although he was careful not to mention him by name.
He had another criticism of the crew, which also included crew chief Al Clark, John Hirschbeck, and Ted Barrett.
Martinez, who improved to 6-1, believes they allowed the Yankees' Bernie Williams to ignore the new directive designed to speed up games.
Williams, Martinez claimed, was allowed to step out of the box at will, often after Martinez was set on the mound.
This made for longer at-bats and contributed to the game lasting 3 hours 45 minutes.
