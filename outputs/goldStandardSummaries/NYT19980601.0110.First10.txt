Carol Hersh-Weiss collects, and then some.
To enter her sprawling New York City apartment is to venture into the nooks and crannies of her decidedly idiosyncratic mind.
Along one wall are 19 pairs of shoes, a small part of a collection of black shoes.
Elsewhere soda bottles bearing forgotten brand names like ``Cheer Up,'' ``Dream'' and ``Just Whistle.''
Hidden in a drawer are thousands of erasers, including one shaped like Ronald Reagan's head.
Antique quilts are everywhere, well over 100 the last time anybody counted.
They have multiplied in value 10 times over in the last 15 years, with many worth more than $1,000.
Mrs. Hersh-Weiss, a professional potter, has told her husband, Norman, a mathematician at Queens College, that quilts beat the stock market hands down.
``I can make more money on my quilts than he can on Microsoft and Intel,'' she said.
