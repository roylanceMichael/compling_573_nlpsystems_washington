Ferretti to Open in SoHo    NEW YORK _ Ever since acquiring a building at 30 West 56th St. for her U.S. headquarters a few years ago, Alberta Ferretti has been extending the reach of her company outside Italy.
She formed Aeffe USA, which produces and distributes the collections of Moschino, Rifat Ozbek, Jean Paul Gaultier and Narciso Rodriguez, in addition to her own lines.
She recently opened in-store boutiques for her signature and Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti lines at Bergdorf Goodman.
And she has now secured a location for her first freestanding store in the United States, in SoHo.
That store, at 452 West Broadway, near Prince Street, is for the Philosophy collection, a lower-priced version of the signature line aimed at a younger woman.
She is still searching for an uptown spot to open an Alberta Ferretti store.
The West Broadway building, next door to a Rizzoli bookstore, is a Federal-style town house built in the late 1800s.
When renovation is completed in late summer, it will have a three-story glass front and skylights, allowing the interior to be bathed in natural light.
There will be a two-story main floor and a mezzanine, with a zigzag staircase and a sloped frosted glass floor.
