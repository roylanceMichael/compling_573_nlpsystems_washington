There was something so completely, utterly and ridiculously over the top about House Speaker Newt Gingrich's trip to Israel last week that the trip actually becomes a useful object lesson.
It is rare that you see such an Olympic-quality, full-body pander for Jewish votes and campaign donations _ without any regard for U.S. interests or regional stability.
This trip was to pandering what a triple lutz is to ice skating.
Consider the context of Gingrich's Israel trip: Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has presented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a fair-minded plan for satisfying Israel's security needs and the Palestinians' territorial requests, and to move the process into final-status talks.
Though the U.S. plan protects Israel's security needs, it does not satisfy every fantasy of every extremist in Bibi's Cabinet.
Therefore, Netanyahu has to choose: Go with the United States and Palestinians, and advance the process but lose part of his coalition, or hold his whole coalition and lose the process.
This is a hard choice for him.
Bibi does not want to be blamed for reigniting the conflict.
It would be Bosnia on the Jordan.
