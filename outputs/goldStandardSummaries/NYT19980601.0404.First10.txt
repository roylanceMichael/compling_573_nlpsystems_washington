This kind of story research I could get used to.
``Pull on your earlobes,'' Tracy Walton tells me over the telephone.
``Now go all the way around, pinching your earlobe gently between your fingers.
Now squeeze your eyebrows with your thumb and index finger.
``Feel that point where your brow meets the bridge of your nose?
Push up right there, real gently.
Isn't it amazing how sensitive that is?''
The question needs no response.
A massage therapist and head of the science department at the Muscular Therapy Institute in Cambridge, Mass., Walton knows the answer.
