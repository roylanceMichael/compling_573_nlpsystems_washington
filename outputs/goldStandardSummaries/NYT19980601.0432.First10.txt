NEW YORK _ Michael Ovitz had better relish a challenge.
Livent Inc., the Toronto-based entertainment company that Ovitz is to assume control of this week, has announced that it lost $20 million in the first quarter of the year, which, added to grim financial results for 1997, means the company has lost approximately $50 million over the last 15 months.
Livent, the producer of recent Broadway musicals like ``Ragtime,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' is the world's only publicly held company whose primary business is live theater production.
Over the last five years it has borrowed heavily to build theaters _ notably the Ford Centers for the Performing Arts in Vancouver, New York City and Chicago (the Chicago theater is scheduled to open in October) _ and to begin creating several musicals from scratch, of which ``Ragtime,'' which now has three companies running, is the first.
In its statement, issued Friday, the company said the quarterly loss, which compared with a profit of $2 million in the first quarter of 1997, was largely a result of the planned closing later this year of one of its two productions of ``Show Boat,'' which is now playing in Washington and San Francisco.
Livent's accounting required the company to count all of the money it spent to put together the show as an expense in the last quarter.
A portion of preproduction expenses is recognized as an expense each quarter in a process known as amortization.
But if a show closes, all of those costs must be recognized at once.
By recognizing the expenses immediately, which was done with the input of the new management, Livent effectively removed costs that could have weighed down its financial performance in the future.
