PHOENIX _ It looks like wilderness, feels like wilderness and _ usual ly _ sounds like wilderness.
But Grand Canyon National Park is not officially wilderness.
Not yet.
But it soon will be, in all but in name.
Under a proposal released Monday, the National Park Service by year's end would manage 94 per cent of the 1.3 million-acre park as if it were officially designated wilderness.
``Wilderness'' is the highest level of protection granted any federal land.
The new management plan, which would not require congressional approval,    would prevent development of roads and buildings, prohibit motorized vehicles and require that more than 120 miles of old roads be turned into trails or restored to their natural condition.
``It's only been in recent times that the hierarch y of the Park Service has recognized the significance of wilderness management,'' said Linda Jalbert, the park's outdoor recreation planner.
``Even though it's a national park, we get a lot of pressure for new uses.''
