SAINT-DENIS, France _ The huge metal ring shimmers and gleams in the middle distance, like a gigantic alien spacecraft looming at the edge of town.
The ring is pierced by 18 steel masts, and cables from atop each mast hold the ring aloft above 80,000 seats.
Struts at the edge of the ring moor it to the Earth.
Otherwise, it would sail away.
If the new Stade de France looks like a hybrid of flying saucer and clipper ship, the image is apt.
The main stadium for the 1998 World Cup of Soccer will bring the eyes of the world to this hard-working industrial town of 92,000 at the northern edge of Paris.
When Saint-Denis welcomes the world to the tournament's opening match on June 10, the world will find itself already there.
The streets teem with immigrants and their children, many from North Africa and Central Africa, some from Asia and Eastern Europe, most of them poor or working-class.
About a fifth of the people of Saint-Denis were not born in France.
