Southern Baptists, meeting in the land of the Latter-day Saints, will be asked to adopt a new denominational statement on marriage, children and the family.
If approved at the annual meeting in Salt Lake City June 11-13, the statement will be added to the Baptist Faith and Message, a 35-year-old document stating what Southern Baptists believe.
The statement, which limits sexual expression to marriage between a man and a woman and encourages wives to be submissive to their husbands, was drafted by a seven-member committee that included the wives of two Baptist seminary presidents.
One of them, Dorothy Patterson, wife of Southeastern Seminary President Paige Patterson, is likely to be the first lady of the convention since her husband is expected to be elected its president.
``I'm very pleased at this time, when the family is under such an assault and attack from every quarter, that Southern Baptists have decided to go back to their biblical roots, determine what God says about the family, and include that in their statement to the word .
.
.''
she told Associated Baptist Press, an independent news organization.
Her husband acknowledged in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the statement makes clear the convention's stance against homosexuality.
