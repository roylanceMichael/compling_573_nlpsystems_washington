HOUSTON _ In April, when transplanted Houston poet Edward Hirsch won a prestigious award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, an aunt in Chicago wondered aloud, ``When are you going to win a prize the family has heard of?''
The answer came when the MacArthur Foundation, famous for awarding genius grants to individuals of all ages and backgrounds who do outstanding and creative work, released the names of 29 new honorees.
The MacArthur Foundation has spent $166 million on its genius grants since the program's inception in 1981.
Hirsch, also a professor in the creative writing program at the University of Houston, was on the list.
``Everybody in my family is wildly excited,'' Hirsch laughed Monday.
``They've heard of this.''
Hirsch got the news late last week but had to keep it secret until the awards were announced.
``I was stunned, I'm still stunned, I don't know what to think,'' Hirsch said.
As he stood in his Houston study, he held a portable telephone that wouldn't stop ringing.
