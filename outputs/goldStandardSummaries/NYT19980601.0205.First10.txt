WASHINGTON _ How long can the U.S. economy keep up its world-beating dynamism of the past six years?
Ask an economist, and you will probably hear a lot about inflation, interest rates and exuberant financial markets.
Ask someone who runs a business today, and the reply will be very different.
The chances are you will be told that the Achilles' heel of America's economic performance is a growing shortage of skilled labor.
More and more companies, particularly those using the most advanced technologies, say they are cutting back expansion plans _ or transferring some operations abroad _ because they simply cannot find enough workers with the requisite skills in the United States.
Many people in business believe the shortage threatens not just the current economic expansion but America's continuing domination of the computer and software technologies that will be crucial to prosperity in the 21st century.
Seen from this angle, a better way of putting the question might be: How long can a country whose high school students score so poorly in mathematics and science hope to retain world technological leadership?
The problem affects virtually every kind of business.
According to a report just published by the Council on Competitiveness, a private, nonpartisan policy forum in Washington, there is ``an acute skills shortage in every part of the country that threatens the foundation of American competitiveness.''
