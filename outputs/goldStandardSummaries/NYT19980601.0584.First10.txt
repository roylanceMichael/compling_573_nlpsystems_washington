NEW YORK _ Edes Gilbert will soon be the last of the grandes dames to step down as head of a selective New York City private girls' school, and thus ends an era of powerful women who cloaked their ambitions in plummy diction and good manners.
Mrs. Gilbert recalls that when she first arrived on the Upper East Side to pull the Spence School out of a slump, she was greeted by her friend Evelyn Halpert of Brearley, the girls' school of choice for the city's intellectual elite.
``It was clear to me that Brearley was running away with the admissions,'' Mrs. Gilbert said.
``It's not that I'm competitive or anything, but I did say, `Watch out!'''
Fifteen years later, Mrs. Gilbert, 66, is retiring as head of an institution that has given Brearley a good run.
Spanish at Spence now starts in third grade, Japanese in seventh.
There are courses on India, Africa and China.
Minority enrollment is up to 17 percent, and the endowment has reached $31 million.
(It was $5 million when Mrs. Gilbert took over.)
