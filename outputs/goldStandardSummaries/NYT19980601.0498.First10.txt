NEW YORK _ In the next phase of the government's crackdown on the Gambino crime family's hierarchy, a suspected top aide to the gang's imprisoned boss, John J. Gotti, will be indicted Tuesday on federal racketeering charges, defense lawyers say.
Investigators said John D'Amico, who has been delegated by Gotti to help run the Gambino family while he is in prison, would be charged on gambling and loan sharking counts.
The investigators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said D'Amico would be added as a co-defendant in a case involving Gotti's son, John A. Gotti, who was indicted in January on extensive fraud and extortion accusations.
An indictment and possible conviction of D'Amico, investigators said, would further weaken the Gambino gang, which has been displaced by the Genovese crime family as the nation's largest and most powerful Mafia faction.
Both groups use the New York City area as their main base of operations.
D'Amico's lawyer, James DiPietro, said in an interview Monday that an indictment against his client might be unsealed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in White Plains, where the case against John A. Gotti, known as Junior, and a dozen other co-defendants is pending.
DiPietro said that based on what he described as ``unofficial reports,'' he believed that D'Amico's arrest was imminent.
``The bottom line is that D'Amico is ready on a moment's notice to surrender,'' he said.
``There is no reason to surround his house at 6 in the morning.''
