Four Massachusetts residents _ including the inventor of the Internet's World Wide Web _ were among the 29 winners of prestigious ``genius grants'' from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the philanthropy announced Monday.
The MacArthur Fellowship grants, which range from $220,000 to $375,000 each, are like the Publishers' Clearinghouse Sweepstakes for the very smart, given to unsuspecting intellectuals who have not applied for the money and rarely know they are under consideration.
Internet pioneer Timothy Berners-Lee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brandeis University religion professor Bernadette Brooten, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, economist Nancy Folbre, and Karl Sims of Genetic Arts Inc. in Cambridge received surprise phone calls last week telling them they had won a fellowship.
``It's really a quest for the most extraordinary among us,'' said Daniel Socolow, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program.
``People are doing the good things they are doing anyway.
This is a statement to them that, `Congratulations, you're doing a good job.
Keep it up.'''
The Chicago-based philanthropy, with assets of about $4 billion, uses ``talent scouts'' to find prospective grant recipients in fields ranging from painting to law to biochemistry.
Since the unusual program began in 1991, the foundation has given away $166 million to fellows, which they can spend as they choose.
