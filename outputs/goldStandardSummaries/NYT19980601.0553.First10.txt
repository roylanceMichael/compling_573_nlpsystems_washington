ALBANY, N.Y. _ Saying he has reduced crime, protected the environment and fought consumer fraud more voraciously than his predecessors, Dennis Vacco announced Monday that he would seek a second term as New York state's attorney general.
Standing on the steps of the state Capitol with Gov.
George Pataki and other powerful Republicans, Vacco said he was the first attorney general in decades to devote equal attention to fighting crime and protecting consumers.
``They said we couldn't reshape the attorney general's office to focus on crime without walking away from the traditional consumer and environmental responsibilities of this office,'' Vacco told about 100 supporters and employees.
``We did it, and I am here today to proclaim, `Mission accomplished.'''
Three candidates have already made it onto the ballot for the Democratic primary in September in hopes of challenging Vacco.
They are Eliot Spitzer, a former state prosecutor; G. Oliver Koppell, a former attorney general, and state Sen. Catherine Abate.
A fourth candidate, Evan Davis, who was counsel to Gov.
Mario Cuomo, has said he will petition to get on the primary ballot.
