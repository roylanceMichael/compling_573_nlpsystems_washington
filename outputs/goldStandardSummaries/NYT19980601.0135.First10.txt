&UR; EDITORS: In honor of Father's Day on June 21, The New York Times Syndicate looks at the changing institution of fatherhood from many perspectives.
We examine the conflicts men face balancing work and family, and the trend toward becoming fathers in middle age.
We offer two essays by dads anticipating Father's Day: one nostalgic and one humorous.
And for those dads who love to hit the links, Jim McKay picks his ten top golfers.

But what about the working dad?
In the 1990s, more and more fathers want to play a significant role in rearing their children, but the workplace is not always so accommodating.
Levine and Pittinsky describe how a father's work affects his family and vice versa, and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better balance.
