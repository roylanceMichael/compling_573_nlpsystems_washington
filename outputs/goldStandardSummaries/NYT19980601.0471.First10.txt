VIENNA, Austria _ Chiding Japan for not addressing its economic problems more adroitly and voicing strong support for the International Monetary Fund, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers warned Monday that problems in Russia and China had the potential to spread elsewhere.
In a speech to banking executives at the International Monetary Conference here, Summers said the health and direction of the Japanese economy were important factors in the recovery of Southeast Asia and scolded Japan and its banks for not acting more boldly to help revive the nation's sagging fortunes.
The Japanese economy has deteriorated in recent months, he said, particularly in the banking sector, with an estimated $600 billion to $1 trillion in bad loans on its books.
Summers lauded Japan's attempts to stimulate its economy, but asked the country and the banks to do more and to do it faster.
``Going forward it will be important to ensure that future fiscal policies are consistent with long-lasting domestic demand-led growth,'' Summers said.
``But it will also be vital to address in a more determined manner the financial sector.''
Summers was at odds with Japanese bankers, who said sufficient steps had been taken to resolve the problems.
``There is too much pessimism about the international competitiveness of Japanese banks,'' said Toru Hashimoto, chairman of Fuji Bank Ltd. ``Many major banks have taken bold steps to improve their financial health by writing off, directly or indirectly, enormous amounts of nonperforming loans at the end of March this year.
Profit levels are now expected to recover steadily, and I believe they will regain their competitiveness within the next three years.''
