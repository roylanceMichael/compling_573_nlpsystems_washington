(Phoenix) - Former world-class wrestler Roman Wroclawski find s himself pinned to the bureaucratic mat _ with little chance of a reversal.
Without comment, Wroclawski's stay of deportation to Poland was denied Monday by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Unless a U.S immigration judge agrees to hear Wroclawski's case, he and his family will be shipped out of the country on June 15 to Poland, where he is accused of treason and political enemies await.
``No explanation was given,'' said Marshall Whitehead, a Phoenix lawyer representing Wroclawski, a 1982 world Greco-Roman champion who trains wrestlers in the Valley.
``It's very cold and there was no effort to try to show some compassion,'' Whitehead said.
Wroclawski, who has been critical of his homeland    in a book, was ordered deported in absentia in March after failing to show for a political asylum hearing.
Though the government sent a letter to Wroclawski's former lawyer, former Arizona Gov.
Raul Castro, notifying him of the hearing, the    letter was lost after Castro signed for it.
Wroclawski, 42, entered the country on a one-year visitor's visa, which expired in March 1995.
