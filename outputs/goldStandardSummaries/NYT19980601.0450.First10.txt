TOKYO _ The Travelers Group and the Nikko Securities Co. formally announced an agreement on Monday that will give the Wall Street powerhouse a 25 percent stake in Japan's third-largest securities brokerage firm for $1.6 billion, a deal that immediately raised questions about how quickly the Japanese financial industry would consolidate.
The Travelers-Nikko alliance, which had been expected since reports of it first appeared here on Friday, came as Japan is undergoing a broad-based financial restructuring aimed at making its markets as flexible as those in New York and London by 2001.
Japanese and foreign companies are exploring possible combinations that will help them better compete in this new arena, and in markets around the world.
``The tie-up between Japanese financial institutions and foreign institutions will accelerate,'' said Yukiko Ohara, a bank analyst with SBC Warburg Japan Ltd. ``Japanese financial institutions need a good product.
They have a very strong client base, but they will lose clients if they have no tie-up.''
The deal also raised concern among competitors and clients of the two companies.
For instance, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, until Monday the largest shareholder in Nikko with 3.1 percent, had envisioned forging its own Nikko alliance.
That is no longer a possibility, and a spokesman said on Monday that Bank of Tokyo would have to revise its strategy toward the securities business.
Nikko has been losing money and is considered poorly prepared to face the challenges of financial deregulation in Japan on its own.
