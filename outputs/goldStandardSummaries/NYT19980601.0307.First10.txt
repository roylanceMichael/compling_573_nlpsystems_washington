WASHINGTON -- The page that has been turned in Ireland now needs to be turned in the United States.
May's astonishing ``Yes'' votes in the North and South, ratifying April's miraculous peace agreement and empowering a new majority that can relegate sectarian concepts of the republic and its still-British North to the past, needs to spark a complimentary transformation in this country.
It can't happen as dramatically, but America's 44 million citizens of Irish extraction need to organize a critical mass capable of sustaining a future-centered relationship between their country and the new Ireland.
Other Americans have done it well _ Italians, Greeks, Jews and, increasingly, Asians, come to mind.
Now it's the Irish-Americans' turn to transcend traditional charity, culture, religion, and knee-jerk republicanism, and mobilize a new generation ready to support a grown-up relationship with a rapidly changing country.
Across the Atlantic, the short-term danger is that the parties to the peace agreement will reconvene in a new Northern Ireland assembly in late summer and gridlock over issues like prisoner release and the turning over of arms and explosives.
The analogy would be with post-Dayton Agreement Bosnia.
Over here, the danger is a loss of momentum.
America's Irish voice, to pick an absurdly extreme example, must not be that of the ostriches in the organizations that flaunted their surly, quixotic republicanism in full-page newspaper ads urging rejection of the peace agreement.
