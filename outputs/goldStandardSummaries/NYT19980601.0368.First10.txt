The Hollywood publicity machine is running full speed for Jim Carrey.
The rubber-faced comedian, who was on the cover of Time last week, graces the covers of New York ($2.95) and Entertainment Weekly ($2.50) this week.
New York writer Chris Smith says Carrey is the perfect actor for ``The Truman Show,'' a movie about a man whose entire life has been a 30-year television soap opera.
In real life, pursued by paparazzi and inquiring reporters, Carrey says he often feels like the movie character.
NUCLEAR FALLOUT: Newsweek ($2.95) examines the implications of the nuclear weapons revival in Pakistan and India.
Newsweek's writers say the threat of warfare is real, but U.S. intervention would be unlikely.
Also: Evan Thomas reports on Robert Kennedy's last campaign on the 30th anniversary of RFK's assassination and Arthur Schlesinger Jr. speculates what the country would have been like if Kennedy had survived.
His conclusion: Vietnam would have ended sooner and there would have been no Watergate.
CULTURAL ICONS: In a list bound to spark debate, Time ($3.95) picks the 20 most influential artists and entertainers of the century.
