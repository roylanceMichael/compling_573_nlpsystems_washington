WASHINGTON _ Sometimes, rich guys finish last.
In a bid to become the Democratic nominee for California governor, businessman Al Checchi has spent more than $30 million.
That's more than anyone has ever spent in a nonpresidential race, political experts say.
And all of it is Checchi's own money.
But after a fast start, Checchi may be poised to finish last in Tuesday's primary election.
Although voters could still surprise the pollsters, the latest surveys show Checchi, who formerly worked in the investment operation of the Bass brothers of Fort Worth, losing ground in the three-way contest with Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis and U.S. Rep. Jane Harman, D-Calif..
In a poll released Thursday, Davis led with 27 percent of likely voters.
Harman had 14 percent, and Checchi, once the front-runner, had fallen to 13 percent.
