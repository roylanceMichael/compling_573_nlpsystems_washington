LONDON _ There are some moments that may have swayed the English football coach's mind against the mercurial midfielder.
It may have been the free-kick which he insisted on taking, then trundled straight to the first Moroccan defender.
Or perhaps it was the off-the-ball kick at Belgium's Vital Borkelmans.
It could have the times he was caught in possession, the times he gave the ball away, the times he raged at the referee.
All of these things Glenn Hoddle saw as he watched Paul Gascoigne playing in Morocco last week.
Most telling of all, however, were the constant little breaks for a breather.
All this nagged away at Hoddle's mind as he considered his England team this weekend and then he acted.
Hoddle, who has backed Gascoigne over his wife-beating, his ``re-fuelling'' problems, his late nights and early baths, finally accepted that this prodigal son could not be kept in the fold.
It is a ``football and fitness'' issue but it is impossible to separate the way Gascoigne lives his life from the effect it has on both.
