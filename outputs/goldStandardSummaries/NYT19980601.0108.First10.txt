FRESNO, Calif. _ Talk about political culture shock.
A day after votes were counted in the Northern Ireland peace referendum, I flew from Belfast to San Francisco to catch the final week of the California primary campaign.
After a month immersed in the low-tech modesty of Irish politics (and writing about it for The New York Times), I was greeted at the airport by an electronic stand-in for the mayor and chief municipal showboat, Willie Brown Jr.
In a message that boomed from above, and over and over, in the international arrivals terminal, Brown introduced himself and welcomed each and every visitor (and prospective voter) to what he grandly called ``My city.''
Had I not been in Ireland 14 hours earlier, I would not have thought twice about this bold piece of self-promotion by a politician who is not even up for re-election.
But I arrived in California with a fresh perspective: Only days earlier, strategists for the Yes campaign in Northern Ireland bickered for 20 minutes (with reporters in the room, no less) over whether it would appear too cynical to print T-shirts with a big, bold, ``YES'' emblazoned across the front.
(They went ahead with the idea and it did not seem to put off voters; the referendum passed easily.)
It may seem unfair to compare two election campaigns that not only are half a world apart but could not be more different.
In Ireland, voters were trying to resolve one of the bloodiest, most enduring conflicts of this century.
