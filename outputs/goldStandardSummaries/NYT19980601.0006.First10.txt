For education officials, setting the school calendar has become as mind-boggling as solving a complex math equation.
They have to take into account religious holidays, federal holidays, contracts with teachers, family vacations and local customs.
This year, they have one more consideration: Labor Day is unusually late, falling on Sept. 7.
And the date is playing havoc with the decision on when to begin classes for the fall.
In Norwalk, Conn., school will start Sept. 1, a bit later than surrounding school districts, but before Labor Day, when many families are still enjoying the last of their summer vacations.
In Farmingdale, on Long Island, students will return to classes on Sept. 3, the first time they have done so before the holiday.
In Perth Amboy, N.J., school officials opted to convene classes on Sept. 9, but to do away with vacation days for two Jewish holidays.
That has angered the teachers' union, which is enlisting the help of Jewish groups and legislators to challenge the schedule.
In New York City, where the teachers' contract says school cannot start before Labor Day, classes will also begin Sept. 9.
