NEW YORK _ Kenneth Joseph Lenihan, a New York research sociologist who helped refine the scientific methods used in criminology, died May 25 at his home in Manhattan.
He was 69.
The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
Lenihan retired in 1995 as an associate professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
He had joined the faculty in 1980, after earlier stints as a researcher at Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, the Vera Institute of Justice in New York and the Bureau of Social Science Research in Washington.
He brought his expertise to the study of recidivism rates among criminal offenders.
He conducted a study in Baltimore, called the Life Project, for the U.S. Department of Labor in the early 1970s.
A large research project, it measured whether and how giving jobs or money to recently released offenders would affect the chances of their becoming repeaters.
That project and further studies formed the basis of a standard work in the field, which he wrote with P. Rossi and D. Berk, ``Money, Work and Crime'' (Academic Press, 1980).
