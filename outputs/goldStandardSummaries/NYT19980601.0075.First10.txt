ATLANTA _ Apple Computer faces no greater challenge than wooing software developers back to the Macintosh.
It is they who will make or break this computer.
With useful, entertaining and progressive software, the Mac will thrive again.
It won't matter how terrific a Mac looks if no one wants to write software for the platform.
Without developer support, the Mac will be like a jilted suitor, all dressed up with nowhere to go.
The problem isn't there is no software for the Mac.
Apple Computer counts some 12,000 existing titles.
Yet this number is misleading.
It says nothing about the vibrancy of the market, how many titles are new, how many are regularly improved.
