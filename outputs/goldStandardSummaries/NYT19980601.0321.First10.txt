Over the years, Kathy Duffy, a 38-year-old school teacher, tried many treatments for her severe incontinence _ pills, injections, exercises, even ``retraining'' her bladder.
Everything helped some.
Even so, she was always ducking out on her second graders to rush to the bathroom.
She didn't sleep much, either.
The urge to urinate woke her every hour or so.
Two weeks ago, Duffy and two other women became the first patients in New England to have a new electrical device called InterStim implanted near their spines to calm bladder spasms.
For the first time in years, Duffy says, she's sleeping five hours at a stretch, thanks to the device, which seems to slow the excessive firing of nerves to the bladder.
Urinary incontinence strikes 15 million Americans, most of them women and most, like Duffy, well under 65.
Unlike Duffy, of Reading, Mass., many of those whose bladders betray them suffer in shameful silence, avoiding other people lest they have an ``accident.''
