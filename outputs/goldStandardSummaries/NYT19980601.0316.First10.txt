Q.
We've debated this question in the locker room for several years.
Should you stop working out or work out at a reduced level when you have a cold?
Does exercise sap energy needed to fight off a cold?

A sports physiologist and a personal trainer we consulted on this question say there is no definitive answer to your question but there simple guidelines to follow when sniffles catch up with you.
First, decide if the symptoms are more cold-like or flu-like, says Ken Baldwin, a personal trainer and president of Premier Fitness Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
If it's simply a cold that's cut your energy levels and given you a runny nose, you might want to work out, but at reduced levels.
