NEW YORK _ ``P.O.V.,'' the public television showcase for independent documentaries, begins its summer season Tuesday night with an offering from the true-confessions department.
Having discovered the magic of the camera, producers commonly turn the lens on themselves and their families and friends on the principle that they must be as fascinating to others as they are to themselves.
``Baby, It's You'' is Anne Makepeace's earnest report of a year of trying, with her husband, Peter Behrens, to have a baby in the new-fashioned way, with the help of fertility drugs and techniques that pluck unfertilized eggs from a woman's ovaries, combine them with sperm and insert them in her fallopian tubes.
Variations on artificial insemination have become a staple of television news magazines, with the camera bringing viewers such intimate sights as the ovary.
For all the biological differences, to my unexpert eye, those pictures look a lot like the fuzzy show my urologist puts on during our periodic visits; it never occurred to me that anybody else might find them of interest.
The hour's angst is filled out by encounters with family members.
The most compelling and emotionally charged connection is between the couple's efforts to have a child and the more successful yet tragic efforts of Behrens' older sister and her lesbian lover to do likewise.
His younger sister's recent abortion stirs painful memories of Ms. Makepeace's own abortion 30 years ago.
As for Ms. Makepeace's two brothers, who take up a fair amount of time _ a reclusive goat herd and an aspiring polygamist (he plans on having 20 children) _ they demonstrate that people can be unconventional yet remain uninteresting.
