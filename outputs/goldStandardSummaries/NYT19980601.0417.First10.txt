STRASBOURG, France _ Most Europeans still think of themselves as French, German, Italian, British or whatever first and Europeans second.
Even the weather reports on the nightly television news in any country seldom report what is happening just across the border.
So building a truly European public television station was a mighty challenge for Arte, a Franco-German cultural broadcasting channel based in this European city, when it started up six years ago.
Arte now transmits cultural and public affairs programming in French and German by satellite to 50 million homes from North Africa and Israel to Scandinavia.
The programming is produced by the French, German, Belgian, Swiss, Spanish, Austrian and Polish partners.
Symbolically based in a Rhineland city claimed by both France and Germany over the centuries and last fought over in World War II, the Arte consortium has a budget of $280 million, most of it provided from the television tax that France and Germany levy on all set owners.
The original French and German stations that set up Arte produce most of what it uses, but it has its own Spartan production facilities scattered over this Alsatian capital.
The people who run it say they want to do for European cultural television what CNN and Britain's Sky News have done for commercial news television, but in a distinctively European way.
``We said from the beginning that although we were a Franco-German enterprise, our future lay in Europe,'' said Hans Robert Eisenhauer, the station's deputy program director, over a glass of riesling and a plate of Alsatian pike-perch and sauerkraut at a restaurant near the station recently.
