ATLANTA _ Your next fishing partner may have a 17-inch screen and a keyboard.
Now that regular folks _ people like you and me _ use computers and the Internet on a daily basis, Web sites do a much better job of representing the non-technical side of life.
Take fishing, for instance.
You'll find literally hundreds of sites that offer fishing reports for lakes in your area; tell you about the hottest lures; and offer advice for experts and beginners as well.
A good place to start is at a Web site called The Fishing Network at http://www.iwn.com/fishing.html.
Because this is a national site, you start by clicking on the section of the country where you live.
Besides offering fishing tips for that section of the country, you'll find some links that would be helpful to most fishermen, including ways to get local weather conditions.
Another good general interest site is called The World of Fishing at http://www.fishingworld.com/.
Some of the news stories and information here seems to be aimed at the professional bass fishermen and those who follow the action at bass tournaments.
