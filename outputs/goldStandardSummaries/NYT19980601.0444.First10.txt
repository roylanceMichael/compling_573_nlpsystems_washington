NEW YORK _ Since the days when Carmen Miranda wore fruit on her head, consumers have been urged to wear Fruit of the Loom apparel on their bodies.
Now the brand is changing its advertising in an attempt to create a more contemporary image.
A lighthearted campaign being introduced this week by Warwick Baker O'Neill in New York, which focuses on newer, more colorful and fashionable types of clothing, declares that ``Every body loves Fruit.''
The television, print and outdoor ads are the first the agency has produced since winning the account late last year, with billings estimated at $20 million to $25 million.
``This advertising is the public expression of efforts going on at Fruit of the Loom to modernize their offerings,'' said Kevin O'Neill, president and chief creative officer at Warwick Baker, who offered a preview of the campaign.
``Its mission is to reawaken the affection and awareness consumers have for the brand and to expand the understanding of Fruit's products.''
The campaign is indicative of large-scale attempts by venerable brands to update their sales pitches, particularly in crowded consumer-product categories like apparel.
Fruit of the Loom Inc. has been laying off employees, closing plants and shifting production to cheaper sites overseas, in response to intensifying competition among makers of underwear and casual wear for men, women and children.
The Hanes brand sold by Sara Lee Corp. has long battled Fruit of the Loom for supremacy in the market segment of lower-priced clothing sold by mass merchandisers.
