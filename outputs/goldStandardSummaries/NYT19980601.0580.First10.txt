NEW YORK _ Jerome Robbins' ``Afternoon of a Faun,'' a ballet about beautiful bodies, received a beautiful performance when it was offered by the New York City Ballet on Sunday afternoon at the New York State Theater.
What helped make it satisfying was Alexandra Ansanelli's debut in the role of a dancer who has a brief romantic encounter with another dancer while rehearsing in a studio.
Ms. Ansanelli made her character a young woman who fully realized how attractive she was, and she took delight in admiring her long, flowing hair.
No wonder she caught the eye of Damian Woetzel, who played a dancer otherwise obsessed with contemplating his own image in a mirror.
But when he surprised her with a kiss, Ms. Ansanelli's expression indicated that this woman was totally unprepared for such attentions.
Both dancers portrayed young people whose bodies had matured more quickly than their emotions.
Robbins was also represented by ``Antique Epigraphs,'' which resembles a series of ancient rituals on some Greek island.
The priestesses on this occasion were Helene Alexopoulos, Maria Kowroski, Riolama Lorenzo and, for the first time in her role, Monique Meunier.
All moved with authority through mysterious ceremonies for which Andrew Lolya served as the flute soloist.
