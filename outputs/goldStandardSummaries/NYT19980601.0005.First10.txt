NEW YORK _ The media turned out in force at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday, anticipating yet another in what has lately been a series of public pronouncements by Cardinal John O'Connor on issues like Little League play on Sundays and domestic partnership legislation.
Perhaps he would weigh in on Terrence McNally's controversial new play, or comment on some other pressing social issue.
The cardinal, however, stayed focused on Sunday's confirmation Mass for 25 Catholics with severe disabilities _ although he did manage to find a few opportunities to tweak the assembled reporters.
``The media may be here because they expect me to say something outrageous today,'' he said, provoking a ripple of laughter through the cathedral.
``But I'm sorry to disappoint you.
I wouldn't dream of trying to upstage these magnificent people.''
Each year on the Feast of Pentecost, St. Patrick's Cathedral offers the Sacrament of Confirmation to people who have prepared through the archdiocese's Office for Persons with Disabilities.
The cardinal told a bit about each of the people, some blind or using crutches or wheelchairs: the 15-year-old who has spina bifida and ``loves animals, and feels he can talk to them''; the 8-year-old who is autistic and loves to play on the swings; the 46-year-old who has brain damage but knows the day of the week by the food he is served.
``He gets eggs on Tuesday,'' the cardinal said.
