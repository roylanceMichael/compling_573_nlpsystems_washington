Delbert McClinton says it plainly, and several times in the course of a brief phone interview from Nashville: His heart is broken.
``I was riding a wave of exultation I had never known,'' he said.
``It was looking like I had a record that was going to break through, and in a heartbeat it was all gone.''
``It'' is Rising Tide, the offshoot of Universal Records that, last fall, released McClinton's exceptional ``One of the Fortunate Few'' CD, easily one of the best in the 57-year-old's storied career.
``One of the Fortunate Few'' features cameos from B.B.
King, Lyle Lovett, John Prine, Vince Gill, Mavis Staples, Patty Loveless and Lee Roy Parnell, among others, and some of McClinton's finest singing.
Released last fall, it picked up strong reviews and healthy sales.
Then, a little over two months ago, Rising Tide was no more.
Universal pulled the plug on the label, which means no more promotion and precious little distribution.
