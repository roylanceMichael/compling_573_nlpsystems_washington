CHICAGO _ The Bulls will leave the plane and take their first giant steps of this finals appearance with the trepidation of an astronaut.
There will be excitement, but uncertainty as they plant themselves on the Delta Center floor in Salt Lake City for Game 1 Wednesday in a land that might as well be another planet this year.
The Utah Jazz has changed, from the climate of its confidence to the topography of its mind-set.
This is not the same Jazz team that was at first awestruck before stretching Chicago to six games in last year's National Basketball Association finals.
And this is not the same swaggering Bulls team that typically enters the finals with all the advantages of the upper crust.
They still have Michael Jordan, but the Jazz holds the home-court advantage.
This has to be unsettling for a Bulls team that was humbled in surviving a seven-game Eastern Conference final against the Pacers, an experience that left the defending champions looking as worn as dust rags.
Perhaps there was only one thing that saved the Bulls' dynasty from extinction Sunday night: home-court advantage.
This most coveted intangible may be the difference between a sixth title for the Bulls and the dismantling of a gilded franchise.
