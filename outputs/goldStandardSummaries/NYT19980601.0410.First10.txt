SAN FRANCISCO _ Jerry Rice won't be doing much this week besides ensuring his knee is progressing back to full strength.
The wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers has been working out regularly and underwent a minor operation earlier last month to remove screws from his damaged left knee.
The screws, which had been placed inside the knee to facilitate healing after his second operation, were taken out because of irritation within the joint.
Rice, who injured the knee twice last season and played in only two games, is expected to be at full strength when training camp begins in July.
As expected, coach Steve Mariucci won't have him involved in too many drills this time of year.
``Jerry's doing well, but he'll be very limited,'' Mariucci said.
The 49ers' final minicamp will run through Thursday.
Mariucci also held camps in March and April.
``The purpose of this minicamp is two-fold,'' Mariucci said.
