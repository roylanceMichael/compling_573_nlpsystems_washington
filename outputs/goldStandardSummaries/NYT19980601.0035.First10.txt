OMAHA, Neb.
_ &UR;  &LR; For half a dozen innings Sunday night, Long Beach State's 49ers tried to play Snow Ball, and it wasn't getting them much.
Finally, in the seventh, they resorted to what has become college baseball's all-too-familiar weapon: the three-run homer.
And because of it, the 49ers have a Snow Ball's chance at the 52nd College World Series after all.
Long Beach State's 7-4 victory over third-seeded Florida State the result of Scott Redfox's second career homer, a three-run shot that snapped a 4-4 tie earned the 49ers a rematch with No.
2-seeded Miami on Tuesday.
And it sent Florida State, a first-round loser to Arizona State, packing, the first team ousted from the double-elimination tournament.
Nothing new there.
``We've been on that early flight back home so many times I even know when to set the alarm clock,'' said FSU coach Mike Martin, a punch-in the-belly reminder that the Seminoles have made more trips to Omaha, 16 now, than anyone else without landing a national championship.
