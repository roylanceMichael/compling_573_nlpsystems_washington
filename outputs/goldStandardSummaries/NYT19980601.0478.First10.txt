NEW YORK _ One of the most heralded investment bets of the last year _ Warren Buffett's purchase of almost 130 million ounces of silver _ now appears to be a money loser.
The price of silver in the last week has dropped close to $5 an ounce, bringing it significantly below the average price of Buffett's silver purchases.
By one calculation, he now has a paper loss of at least $14.1 million, a 2.1 percent decline in the value of his entire silver investment.
In the 1997 annual report for Berkshire Hathaway Inc., his investment vehicle, he said he had a profit of $97.4 million on his silver investment as of the end of last year.
For Buffett, these losses are no more significant in his portfolio than his bridge losses.
But they have been far more painful for the investors who like to follow Buffett wherever he goes.
When he announced his silver investment after the close of the markets on Feb. 3, the price of silver on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange had already soared to $6.615 an ounce, 53 percent higher than it was on July 25, when Buffett began accumulating the metal.
The price quickly shot as high as $7.40 an ounce in intraday trading on Feb. 5.
Then the hangover began to set in.
