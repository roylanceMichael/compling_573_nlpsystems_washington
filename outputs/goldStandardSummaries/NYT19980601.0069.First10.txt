AUSTIN, Texas _ In April, the country's biggest meat-packing company recalled more than 282,000 pounds of ground beef after a virulent strain of E. coli bacteria was found in a package.
That same month, two children in Abilene and four in Greenville became ill with E. coli.
On Tuesday, in nearby Grayson County, a 33-year-old Denison man died from E. coli infection.
Public health officials have been working to rule out a connection among the cases _ one that would point to a common food source still endangering other people.
Coming to the epidemiologists' aid is a new, nationwide early alert system for identifying E. coli 0157:H7, the bacterium that in 1993 killed four children and was traced to Jack in the Box restaurants.
``We're going to be able to act while the meat is still out there,'' said Virginia Headley, a public health bacteriology specialist for the Texas Department of Health.
``By being able to get it off the market, we'll be able to prevent cases.
That's the ultimate goal -- to react in a quick enough time to make an impact.''
The Texas Department of Health is one of 16 state labs participating in PulseNet, a computer database network linked to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta that can rapidly compare different strains of E. coli from different sources.
