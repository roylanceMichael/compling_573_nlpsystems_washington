Alice Saltzman sees her part-time job as a mission.
By working with medical students, she hopes to make one of the most uncomfortable aspects of medicine a gentler, less intimidating process _ for both patient and doctor.
A New York social worker turned actress, Ms. Saltzman, 36, and her colleagues around the country are playing an increasingly important role in medical education.
Called genital teaching associates, or GTAs, they use their bodies as models to teach breast, pelvic and genital-urinary examination techniques to medical students, residents and even doctors.
``When I was a social worker, I became very concerned about how women were treated,'' Ms. Saltzman said.
When she learned about the associates through a colleague who was in the field, she became curious.
``I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do it.
But now, I feel like I'm helping women all over the world.
It's very empowering.''
