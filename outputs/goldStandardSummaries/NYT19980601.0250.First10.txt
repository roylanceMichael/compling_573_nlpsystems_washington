ALBANY, N.Y. _ Collecting Beanie Babies _ the little stuffed animals that made their debut in 1994 and now sell in the millions _ has become a phenomenon notable for its appeal to adults.
Two moms share the hold Beanie Babies have on them, and offer a glimpse into the local Beanie Baby network that is tuned in to all things Beanie:    Yes, we confess.
We are Beanieholics, adults obsessed with bagging that new, overlooked, coveted bit of plush out there for under $7.
We are not serious collectors, just part of the crowd bitten by the Beanie bug.
But lately, we're noticing our tales of Beanie pursuits are being greeted by the rolling of eyes instead of enthusiasm.
Our children are starting to worry about us.
Our co-workers wonder what powerful substance, possibly embedded in the plastic pellets or ``beans'' stuffed inside these creatures, keeps us continuously on the hunt.
Our Beanie information is gleaned on-line, by word of mouth, and via an informal telephone network of the similarly obsessed.
We also make phone calls to favorite retailers, although this now frequently means listening to recorded messages on Beanie availability.
