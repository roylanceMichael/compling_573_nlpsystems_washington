Cost of signing picks, court action may force change    &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL;   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;  The annual draft of college and high school baseball players _ an exercise that for decades was locked in time as the rest of sport's economic picture took wing _ takes place today amid questions about its future viability.
The first pick in the draft belongs to the Philadelphia Phillies, a team that spent 11{ months holding strong in the face of the explosive growth of contract demands by top selections.
Last June, the Phillies took outfielder J.D.
Drew with the second overall pick but refused to pay the reported $11 million signing bonus demanded by Drew.
Drew is back in the draft this year, but the Phillies will not select him.
They are expected to take third baseman Pat Burrell of the University of Miami, a player whose demands are expected to be far less than Drew's and whom the Phillies believe they will be able to sign.
The latest word among draft prognosticators is that the Oakland Athletics, who have the No.
2 pick, also will not select Drew.
Nor will the Chicago Cubs or Kansas City Royals.
