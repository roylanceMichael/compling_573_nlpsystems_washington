SAN FRANCISCO _ During a particularly wicked rainstorm at last year's U.S. Open in Bethesda, Md., shelter was at a premium.
The various hospitality tents were packed, and that concerned Jon Barker.
Barker was at Congressional Country Club on a fact-finding mission.
As the championship coordinator for the 1998 U.S. Open, to be played at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, Barker worried aloud about the need for bigger tents in case of rain.
``They just looked at me and said, `Don't worry about that.
Never, ever worry about that in San Francisco.
It never rains in San Francisco in June,''' Barker said.
Welcome to never-never land.
The June 18-21 tournament is nigh and, strange as it seems, Barker's concerns don't seem so far-fetched anymore.
