ATLANTA _ Family Tree Maker is the giant of genealogy computer programs, with more than 1 million copies sold.
It is an excellent program, but my wife, Donna, the genealogist, believes much of its popularity comes from the wealth of information on the nine CDs that come with the deluxe version.
Her report:    You get the Family Finder index (a list of 130 million people who can be traced through birth, marriage, census and miscellaneous records); the Social Security Death Index (birth and death dates, Social Security number and last ZIP code for 54 million people); and the World Family Tree (130 million people on family trees submitted by 27,000 family researchers).
Another 13 World Family Tree discs are available, 18 in all.
The newest version _ 4.4 _ comes with expanded online services.
You can search the Internet for every name in your file, add a Family Tree Maker book to your home page and take advantage of a free record lookup from Genealogy Research Associates.
Setting a home page was easy _ and free.
I included our immigrants by surname, where they settled, when they immigrated and where they came from.
Although you can have the ``agents'' on Family Tree Maker's Web page search for every name in your file, there wasn't much point to look for all our Elizabeths who were listed only by given name.
