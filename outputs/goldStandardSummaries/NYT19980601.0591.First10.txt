LOS ANGELES -- The news that drug makers American Home Products Corp. and Monsanto Co. will merge in a $34.4 billion stock swap has revived speculation over the future of biotechnology powerhouse Amgen.
Under terms of the deal announced early Monday, American Home will exchange 1.15 shares for each Monsanto share, based on Monsanto's closing price Friday of $55.56 a share.
American Home makes products such as Advil painkiller and Chap Stick lip balm.
Monsanto makes products ranging from the artificial sweetener Nutrasweet to Roundup herbicide, and is active in agricultural biotechnology.
Management of the two midsize companies determined they could no longer face bigger rivals alone.
If shareholders and regulators approve the merger, it would create a $96 billion life sciences company with $3 billion in expected annual profits.
The new entity, still to be named, will be 65 percent owned by American Home shareholders.
The stock swap provides American Home with a strong partner following a difficult year.
In September, the company withdrew two obesity drugs after it was found they could cause coronary bleeding.
