NEW YORK _ By one count, Dmitry Rachmanov, a Russian-born pianist now widely active in the New York area, played three encores on Thursday evening in his recital at Merkin Concert Hall.
Almost inevitable under the circumstances were Liadov's ``Musical Snuffbox'' and Rimsky-Korsakov's ``Flight of the Bumblebee,'' but a Scriabin nocturne for the left hand made for a distinctive close.
By another reckoning, Rachmanov played hardly anything but encores.
His program, ``The Art of the 19th-Century Russian Character Piece,'' offered ditties and little more by 10 composers ranging in fame from Felix Blumenfeld (a ``moment lyrique'') to Tchaikovsky (``Reverie du Soir'' and ``Dumka'').
A few years ago the term ``thematic programming'' seemed to become a value judgment: Any theme was good; any program without one was fatally flawed.
The resulting experience has amply shown otherwise.
Character, or characteristic, pieces are pianistic attempts to capture moods, often fleeting, using a dance, a march, a pastoral or nostalgic turn, or the like.
They are best taken in small, concentrated doses.
An evening of them, especially in a single national style, palls quickly with repetitive gesture, now gentle, wistful or nostalgic, now dark, bold or brave.
