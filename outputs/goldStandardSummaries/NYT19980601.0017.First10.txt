CHICAGO _ The game took 2 hours 34 minutes, and for Michael Jordan, it had to feel like 15 brutal rounds, the way it felt years ago for the aging Muhammad Ali.
Jordan once flew the way the young Ali danced, but at 35, against Larry Bird's swarming Indiana Pacers, in the fourth quarter of a seventh game, Jordan had nowhere to go but the clinches.
He fought in flurries.
He went to the boards.
He drove the ball into a crowd of hacking behemoths.
He and his team won with heart and guile and, like Ali until he had nothing left, because Jordan had promised that was precisely what he would do.
``He's been the greatest,'' his coach, Phil Jackson, said without prompting after Jordan and the Bulls won Game 7, 88-83, on Sunday night and survived the Eastern Conference finals against an opponent Jordan earlier in the series had mistakenly classified as nothing more daunting than a ``bump in the road.''
As it turned out, the Bulls began their ascent over this bump when Jordan won a jump ball from a 7-footer.
It was the middle of the fourth quarter and the Bulls were sagging, with Jordan struggling, with their front line plagued by fouls.
