McCormack said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called US Ambassador Charles Ries earlier in the day and that Greece's foreign minister, Dora Bakoyannis, met with Ries shortly after the attack.
State television said she had written to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to promise full cooperation in efforts to find the attacker, but the conservative government was criticized in Greece over the attack at Athens' most heavily guarded site.
It was the first major attack against a U.S. target in more than a decade, following the arrest of members of Greece's far-left November 17 terrorist group.
At the behest of the Greek prime minister, the officer who headed Greece's anti- terrorism squad at the time of November 17's break-up, Stelios Syrros, has been appointed to lead the investigation into the rocket attack on the embassy.
