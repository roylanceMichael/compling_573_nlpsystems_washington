''In some ways I see hunting of grizzly bears in the future as positive tool,`` said Kim Barber, the U.S. Forest Service's grizzly bear and wolf coordinator for the Rocky Mountain region
The 5-year-old male was the first of 19 grizzly bears to die in the region surrounding Yellowstone National Park and one of 50 killed in the lower 48 states, making 2004 the worst year for grizzly mortality since the animal was added to the endangered species list in 1975.
"The Yellowstone grizzly is the Endangered Species Act's best recovery story," said Chris Servheen, a University of Montana professor and head of the federal agency's grizzly bear recovery team.
