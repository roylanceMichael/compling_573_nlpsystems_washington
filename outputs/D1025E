Before delisting can occur, state and federal agencies in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho must establish bear management plans.A draft proposal to take the grizzlies off the endangered species list went out this summer from field offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current ``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.France said Montana, Wyoming and Idaho -- working with federal agencies -- are well prepared to guarantee the long-term health of Yellowstone's grizzlies.``We think we should embrace success when it happens,'' said Sterling D. Miller, a grizzly bear specialist and senior wildlife biologist here in the federation's Northern Rockies officeTwenty-one grizzlies have been illegally killed here in northwest Montana in the past two years, a record pace for poaching since the bears were listed 30 years ago as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.But Chuck Neal, an ecologist and bear expert retired from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Wyoming, said an anti-bear hysteria drives the hunting discussion He's particularly concerned that state and local officials -- susceptible to citizen pressure -- will establish bear management plans that permit bear killing in a broad array of circumstances.Yellowstone boasts the largest grizzly population in the lower 48 states, though a few smaller groups live in areas such as the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem near Canada, Montana's Cabinet Yaak wilderness and Idaho's Selkirk Mountains.John Emmerich, assistant wildlife division chief at Wyoming's Game and Fish Department, said environmentalists aren't showing enough faith in state officials who have spent years and millions of dollars helping promote the bears' recovery.Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.State and federal agencies will monitor the bears and their habitat and responsibility for managing bears will be turned over to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.Federal bear biologists contend the rust is moving more slowly in Yellowstone than in northwest Montana and that the trees have co-evolved with mountain pine beetles for thousands of years."My experience is that the things happening in Yellowstone are things we really have no control over," said Dave Mattson, a U.S. Geologic Survey research biologist.Federal grizzly bear biologists in Montana say that years of research shows that the bear population around Yellowstone is robust and recovered.No one questions that Yellowstone's grizzlies have rebounded over the past three decades since they were listed -- the population has been growing at a rate of 4 to 7 percent a year for several years -- in part because state and federal officials abolished trash dumps that used to lure bears and bring them into dangerous contact with humans.The rising death toll alarms federal law enforcement officials, as well as government biologists supervising the otherwise successful comeback of the big bears.
