White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys' Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand jury.
After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey.
A few hours after the dinner, White and Ramsey were searching the basement of the Ramsey house when Ramsey emerged from a room with his daughter's battered body.
In the past, Hal Haddon, Ramsey's lead lawyer, has demanded police investigations of leaks that seemed to implicate the Ramseys.
