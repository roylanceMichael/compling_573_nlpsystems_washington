Now that the four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a schedule for the pretrial proceedings.
After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether the officers waive their right to a jury trial.
Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see the officers not only charged, but brought to trial.
In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by police stop-and-search tactics.
