NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African immigrant.NEW YORK _ With the indictments barely unsealed against four police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.But several officers are said to have told associates that the chain of events that led to the fatal shooting of Diallo began when the officers first spotted him and thought that they saw him looking into the window.Lawyers for the four officers spoke separately in court, offering the first glimpse of the defense account of what went wrong the night they confronted Diallo outside his Bronx apartment building.Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges.NEW YORK _ The four New York City police officers charged with murdering Amadou Diallo returned to work with pay Friday after attending a morning court session in the Bronx in which a Jan. 3 trial date was set.The defense lawyers called their clients ``political prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy, not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fireNEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks ago.The lawyers also said there could be pretrial scheduling conflicts because of other trials some of them are involved in, like the Abner Louima case, in which officers are accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant.A lawyer representing one of the officers in the shooting, Stuart London, has criticized the delays in unsealing the indictments against the officers, particularly since the grand jury voted on the charges last Thursday.After leaving court, one of the officers, Carroll, shook hands with supporters and said in a quivering voice, ``I want to thank the New York City police officers and the Street Crime Unit for their undaunted support.NEW YORK _ Some of the police officers who shot and killed Amadou Diallo have told associates that their attention was initially drawn to Diallo when they saw him standing on the stoop of a Bronx apartment building and thought they saw him peering into the window of a first-floor apartment, according to people with knowledge of the case.NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers were charged with murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a painful examination of police tactics and race relations.NEW YORK _ Now that the four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a schedule for the pretrial proceedings.Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired subsequent rounds.Outside Bronx Supreme Court on Tuesday, about 400 off-duty police officers chanting ``No Justice, No Police'' and ``Its a Tragedy, Not a Crime'' rallied to show support for the four police officers before their expected arraignment.
