According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20 percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily" reports today.
The survey was conducted jointly by the Xiangshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition and Food Research Section of the Shanghai Medical Science University.
People in the 7-12 and 60-70 age groups run a greater risk of becoming overweight, and incidence of obesity in males is higher than in females, the survey showed.
More than half of the 710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to studies by a leading local nutritionist.
Head of the center, William Ng Man-sui, said concern over an increasing number of young children with obesity problems had prompted him to research the eating habits of upper-grade students at all seven primary schools in Chai Wan, a district in the east of Hong Kong island.
