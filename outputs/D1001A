A wave of copycat threats of violence prompted by the Tuesday massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., prompted school and law-enforcement officials across the country to respond quickly to any new sign of trouble, even if the threats were pranks brought on by a dose of youthful spring fever.
The sheriff's initial estimate of as many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims more than once.
There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine students and Columbine Valley residents.
Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and houses sprouted up around it.
Many wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- even portable toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial ribbons.
