Greek radio and television stations reported that the air force pilots in the two fighter jets did not see any movement in the cockpit of the airliner before the crash and it was unclear if the two pilots were in their seats.
Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
Teams of rescue workers, firefighters and ambulances, meanwhile, scrambled to the wooded crash site as authorities evacuated a nearby monastery threatened by a brush fire started by the crash.
Cyprus' radio and television stations cancelled their daily programs to relay uninterrupted coverage on the crash as people telephoned to seek news or speculate over what might have caused the crash.
