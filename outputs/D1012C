9:37 a.m. (0637 GMT) _ The plane enters Greek airspace and is identified by Greece's Civil Aviation Authority.
Two Greek fighter pilots, peering into the plane, saw "a lifeless cockpit," according to a Greek air force spokesman, even though the Helios Air Boeing 737 continued flying, apparently on autopilot, for nearly three-quarters of an hour before it slammed into a wooded, uninhabited gorge near the town of Grammatikos at 12:03 p.m.
He was wearing an oxygen mask, apparently unconscious, Greece's government spokesman, Theodore Roussopoulos, said after a marathon crisis meeting led by the Greek prime minister.
