But Dr. Steve Finkbeiner and colleagues at the University ofCalifornia in San Francisco and the university's Gladstone Instituteof Neurological Disease have discovered that the mutant protein thatclumps inside the brain cells of Huntington's patients actually savescells from dying.
A new robotic microscope that follows a brain cell in the lab froma normal state to its death has led researchers to a surprisingfinding that appears to debunk a long-standing theory aboutHuntington's disease.
Californians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to become the first USstate to fund controversial embryonic stem cell research that waseffectively banned by President George W. Bush, US media reported.

Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's andAlzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfoldingand clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.
A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormonedopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorderParkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.
An international research team, led byscientists at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), has discovered agene which, when mutated, causes Parkinson's disease in somefamilies.
The health of the 75-year-old has been a subject of intensespeculation in recent years, in part because of the tremor in hislips and hands, considered as a possible symptom of Parkinson'sdisease.
Although Parkinson's disease is usually not inherited, thediscovery of this gene and further study of how it works could openup new avenues of research for preventing or delaying the onset ofthe disease.
Speaking clearly and appearing in good form, Pope John Paul II saidSunday that he was united in spirit with Roman Catholics attending acongress in Mexico.
