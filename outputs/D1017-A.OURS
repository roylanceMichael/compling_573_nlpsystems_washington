A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times thesize of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructivepounded toward Florida Monday, forcing hundreds of thousands fromtheir homes and leaving countless residents to hope that themassive storm would somehow miss their cities.
The prospect of an extremely powerful, coast-hugging hurricane``was a scenario that ever since I've been here I've hoped I'dnever see,'' Witt said Monday, noting that the destruction couldcover ``not just one area, it's the whole coastline and thepounding it's going to take.''
All day Monday, state meteorologists offered hope that HurricaneFloyd would be nudged from its westerly course by a trough of lowpressure air moving to the east and southeast, and, instead ofmaking landfall in South Florida, travel up the coast, itsdangerous eye offshore.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd wasexpected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, andit could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northernBahamas.
This could be the storm FEMA Director James LeeWitt has been dreading since taking office six years ago: acatastrophic hurricane that hugs the coastline from Florida to theCarolinas, causing massive damage along a swath hundreds of mileslong.
From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral,hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populatedFlorida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, creptwestward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
``We need people to get ready right now, not tonight, not  tomorrow,'' said Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for Brevard County, which ordered tens of thousands of people living in mobile homes and coastal areas to evacuate beginning at 4 p.m. today.
``We've tried to prepare for the worst possible case, and thisis one of those cases,'' said Witt, head of the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency after concluding a video conference withemergency teams spread out across the country.
Tropical storm Floydstrengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane thisyear, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will takeit north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern UnitedStates.
