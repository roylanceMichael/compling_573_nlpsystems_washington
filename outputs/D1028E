Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
The names, addresses and employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on November 12 in Sacramento, California.
A federal judge has rejected a motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
Kaczynski, a 54-year-old former mathematics professor, is accused of being the Unabomber, who killed three people and injured 23 during a campaign against technology between 1978 and 1995.
Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the trial to another city.
The judge in the trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of defense requests for revisions in jury selection.
