Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan."
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
A statement by Labor foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd said Friday's court ruling "has confirmed the Howard governments spineless and hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in the Australian Whale Sanctuary".
Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock.
Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court to sue Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku for allegedly killing around 400 minke whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
