Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said only words are not enough to stop Japan's plans for the slaughter and the New Zealand "Government must take serious action against Japan."Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal.Australia's Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday defended his decision not to intercept whaling boats found in Antarctic waters, saying Japan and many other countries do not recognize Australian territorial claims in Antarctica and a whaling sanctuary that is protected under Australian law.But the government opposes an application in Australia's Federal Court to prevent a Japanese whaling company entering the Australian-declared whale sanctuary in Antarctica, which Japan does not recognise.Australia last week warned Tokyo it was embarking on an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to dissuade Japan from trying to escalate its killing of whales.Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said in the submission given to the court in January that the government had no right to enforce its law on Japan because Tokyo did not recognise Australia's claim of territorial sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory.Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with an IWC moratorium in 1986, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "scientific research whaling".Opponents of the plan have claimed that Japan is seeking to double to 800 the number of minke whales it will slaughter each year, and to add 50 humpback whales and 50 fin whales.Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium.Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium, but the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "research whaling".In rejecting the application, Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction there.Environment Minister Ian Campbell said Japan risks damaging its reputation in the eyes of most Australians if it persists with plans to hunt humpback whales.Campbell said the catching of humpback whales, which migrate the west and east coasts of Australia in increasing numbers, "is something that will potentially seriously damage the way Australians perceive Japan."Judge James Allsop based the rejection on a submission to the court by Canberra saying the government cannot legally stop the whaling company hunting in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction over the waters.
