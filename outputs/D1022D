Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal.
Campbell said he would visit key European players in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) -- including France, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden -- to reinforce Australia's anti-whaling position.
