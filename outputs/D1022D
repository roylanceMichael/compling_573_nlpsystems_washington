Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan."
Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock.
