Many immediately drew parallels between the murder of Van Gogh, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, and the assassination of outspoken politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6, 2002.
Dutch politicians and commentators were united Tuesday in their condemnation of the murder, in broad daylight on an Amsterdam street, of controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh and called for calm together with representatives of the Dutch Muslim community.
Van Gogh, the great great nephew of 19th-century Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, was a staunch critic of multicultural society as a whole.
"We ask the inhabitants of Amsterdam to keep cool and cope calmly with this murder and to bid farewell in a dignified manner to Theo van Gogh," the Moroccan Municipal Assembly in Amsterdam said, calling the murder despicable.
Van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter Vincent van Gogh, had received death threats after the broadcast of the short TV film, "Submission."
