Schwartzbach was expected to conclude his closing arguments Friday, with jurors
expected to get the case after prosecutors have a chance to rebut defense

grist for a true-life pulp novel.Schwartzbach also took aim at another key prosecution witness:

his wife dead.Yet experts downplayed Schwartzbach's attempt to blame the police
for allegedly mishandling evidence and focusing on Blake too early in
the investigation
