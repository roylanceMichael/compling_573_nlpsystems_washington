Gold Standard Summaries are in /goldStandardSummaries
and they have the form:
doc name:  name.A.001.txt

where "A" is first-10 method of summarizing.

other gold standards for the same doc will have the form "name.B.001.txt" etc.

this crappy convention is to remain in keeping with rouge evaluation.
