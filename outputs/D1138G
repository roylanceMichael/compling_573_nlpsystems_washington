About 1.5 million patients need organ transplant each year, but only 10,000 can find organs for transplant, according to statistics from the Ministry of Health.
It is the first step in a new push by the United Network for Organ Sharing to decrease the number of children who die awaiting an organ transplant, a toll particularly high for infants and toddlers.
Neither surgeon was recovering the organs on behalf of Kaiser; rather, they were working on behalf of the local group that procures and distributes organs in the region.
