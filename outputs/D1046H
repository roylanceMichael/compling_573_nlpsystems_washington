Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said.
Japan on Tuesday put its army, air force and navy on standby to provide assistance to survivors of Asia's tsunami disaster, with most of their work expected to be in worst-hit Indonesia.
The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane headed for Medan, the main city on Indonesia's Sumatra island, one of the areas hardest hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami, the ministry said in a statement.
