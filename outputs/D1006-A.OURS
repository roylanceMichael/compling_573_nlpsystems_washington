Thoughthe new study was more comprehensive than past research because itlooked at patients over the course of three years, research sinceNovember 2000 has suggested that those who take Vioxx face a heartattack risk four to five times greater than those who take older,equally effective arthritis treatments such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
Studies done five years ago when Celebrex and Merck &amp; Co.'s Vioxxwere approved suggest that the same mechanism that inhibitsinflammation and makes the drugs easier on the stomach thantraditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heartproblems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University ofPennsylvania cardiologist.
Dr. David Graham, associate director for science in the drug safetydivision of the Food and Drug Administration, by early August hadnotified his supervisors that a study of Vioxx showed patients on thestarting dose had 50 percent greater risk of cardiac arrest thanthose on competitor Celebrex.
Writing in the medical journal, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chief ofpharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania, said studies suggestthe same mechanism that makes the drugs easier on the stomach thantraditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heartproblems.
The Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts whoraised safety concerns weeks before Merck &amp; Co. yanked theblockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack andstrokes, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Thursday.
Momentum was growing for a fresh look at the safety of Celebrex andother pain relievers as key researchers, a congressman and Europeanregulators said they feared such drugs might raise the risk of heartproblems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.
Seven weeks before Merck &amp; Co. pulled the arthritis drug Vioxxoff the market because of safety concerns, federal drug regulatorsdownplayed the significance of scientific findings citing theincreased risks, documents released Thursday show.
Backed by a $195million ad campaign, featuring testimonials from former skater DorothyHamill and music by the Rascals to appeal to aging baby boomers, Merckhad sold Vioxx to more than 20 million Americans since its approval in1999 and millions more worldwide.
For five days Merck had been struggling with what to do withfrightening new data that showed that long-term use of their $2.5billion arthritis drug Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks andstrokes, confirming concerns raised by earlier studies.
Over the past two weeks The Washington Post had interviewedindependent researchers who collected and reviewed the Vioxx data,company officials who decided how Merck would respond, critics of thedrug industry and regulators who, in the end, played almost no role inits recall.
