It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80 percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.Even in the higher diversity areas of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, there are few encouraging signs for reefs for increasing human pressures.The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D.Retired Navy Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, a Commerce Department undersecretary who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, called reefs a global issue."Reefs provide seafood for one billiocautioned.Before the hurricanes struck, the scientists, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Florida, began examining reefs stretching about 130 miles from Fort Pierce to north of Miami."Reefs provide seafood for one billion people in Asia alone, many of them from poor communities."Reefs need our help, but they're not going to go extinct," said Clive Wilkinson, the study's lead author and coordinator of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.A major problem would be a loss of fish, displaced by the waves from their habitat, and other forms of protein which depend on the reefs.The report warned that the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.The group suspended its activity for two months while hurricanes Frances and Jeanne pounded the region; when they returned, they found that reefs in northern Palm Beach County had been scoured clean of macroalgae such as seaweed.The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.About half the reefs that were left badly damaged after the 1997-98 El Nino event have bounced back, Baker said."Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs," Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef survey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the tsunami struck, said in an e-mail.The conservation union -- which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species -- also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
