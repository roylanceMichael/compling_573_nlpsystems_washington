More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs," Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef survey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the tsunami struck, said in an e-mail.
