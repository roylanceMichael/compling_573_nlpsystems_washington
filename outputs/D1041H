For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from global warming.
Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.''
An additional 24 percent ``are under imminent risk of collapse through human pressures,'' and an additional 26 percent ``are under a longer term threat of collapse.''
Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly resilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals, but because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.
