Discarded utility poles were submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's fishery resources conservation efforts.
The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).
Over the past three decades, Taiwan has created a large number of artificial reefs made from discarded utility poles, decommissioned naval vessels and discarded tires at 100-plus designated areas along the coastline to enhance fishery resources.
