In Gaza, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a militia loosely affiliated with the mainstream Fatah movement of President Mahmoud Abbas, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had been carried out in conjunction with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and a previously unknown group calling itself the National Resistance Companies.
Israel has been away from suicide attacks for about one year since the last one struck southern Israeli town of Eilat, a Red Sea resort, on Jan. 29, 2007, which claimed three lives.
