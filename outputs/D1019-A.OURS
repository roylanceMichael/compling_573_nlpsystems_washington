Philippine President JosephEstrada Monday ordered the Philippine military forces to go afterthe six armed pirates who reportedly kidnapped some 20 people,mostly foreigners, in eastern Malaysia, a senior Philippineofficial said.

By the time they arrived at the Kuala Lumpur InternationalAirport late Monday, they were among the few escapees of a massabduction by mysterious gunmen 24 hours earlier which left 20hostages still missing in Southeast Asian waters.
A total of 20 people weretaken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadanisland off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind theabduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.

Muslim rebels who have beenholding 27 Filipinos hostage at a remote mountain stronghold in thePhilippines claimed responsibility Tuesday for also abducting about20 people from a nearby Malaysian tourist island.
Authorities hunted the seas betweenMalaysia and the Philippines today for two fishing boats controlledby heavily armed men holding 21 hostages they abducted from aMalaysian diving resort two days earlier.
''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (inMalaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the governmentif they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad toldPhilippine radio station DXRZ.
Rescue teams were searching SoutheastAsian seas on Tuesday for assailants who abducted 20 hostages froma Malaysian diving resort -- an attack that Philippine Muslim rebelsclaimed they carried out.
