According to U.S. records, the United States sprayed about 12 million gallons (45 million liters) of Agent Orange over parts of southern and central Vietnam in 1961-71.
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai in April assigned the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs to conduct a survey on the estimated 300,000 Agent Orange victims in Vietnam.
A 1989 court ruling in the case voided all VA benefit decisions it had made based on the agency's assertion that only the skin disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange.
The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
The paper quoted Nguyen Trong Nhan, chairman of the Vietnam Red Cross, as saying those affected by the toxic chemical will receive assistance from the fund by the year 2000 after a survey on Agent Orange victims is completed next year.
