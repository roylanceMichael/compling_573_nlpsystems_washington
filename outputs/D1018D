in a scene that seemed to sum up every bizarre aspect of the investigation and press frenzy -- TV crews chased Paulus Van Der Sloot, a judge, and the father of one of four detained suspects in the case, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17.
Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten refused to identify Croes by name Friday but said that the latest detainee was arrested based on information provided by one of the three young men already in custody.
"He was questioned as a witness, no more or no less," van der Straaten told The Associated Press, declining to give details.
On Wednesday, investigators towed two vehicles and searched the premises of the van der Sloot home in Noord, outside the capital of Oranjestad.
She was last seen by friends leaving the Oranjestad nightclub Carlos 'N Charlie's with Van Der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers.
