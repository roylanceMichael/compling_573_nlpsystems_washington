A fourth man, a tour boat disc jockey, was arrested Friday as the latest suspect in the case of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway.Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers _ less than a day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members started looking.Accompanied by her husband and friends including Bearman on a donated corporate jet, Holloway Twitty had a few bits of information from Mountain Brook graduates who were on the trip, most importantly a physical description of a Dutch teenager _ a judge's son, they thought _ with whom Natalee was seen leaving a bar, Carlos' N Charlies', on May 30, the night she disappeared.Van der Sloot claimed he left Holloway outside the Holiday Inn resort where the group was staying after they took a late-night trip to a scenic lighthouse, Bearman said, and he even accompanied the family to the hotel to show them the exact spot where she was dropped off.Natalee Holloway's family, not Aruban police, first identified and located a Dutch youth now held as a suspect in the disappearance of the Alabama teen, according to a friend who helped with the search.While Aruban police were present during the questioning of van der Sloot, which lasted until about 3 a.m., officers left the talking to Holloway's family until things began to get "heated," Bearman said.NOORD, Aruba (AP) _ Police on Thursday searched for clues into the disappearance of an Alabama teen a day after conducting a late-night helicopter flyover of the Dutch Caribbean island and seizing items from the home of a Dutch justice official whose son was with her the day she went missing.But Antonius "Mickey" John, a former hotel security guard released from custody on Sunday, told reporters that Deepak Kalpoe told him during a chat in jail that he and his brother actually dropped the young van der Sloot and Holloway off together near the Marriott, about 10 blocks north of the Holiday Inn.Almost a week after arresting the son of a prominent Dutch judge in the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, officials in Aruba searched his home Wednesday.Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard, but both have since been released.The search came shortly after Paul Van Der Sloot filed a motion in court Wednesday morning seeking permission to see his jailed son, who along with brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, are the last known people to have seen Holloway.A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 -- the three prime suspects in the case, who were the last people known to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee hours of May 30.But Tuesday, John said Deepak Kalpoe told him in jail this weekend that he and his brother dropped Van Der Sloot and Holloway off at the Marriott hotel before they went home.Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
