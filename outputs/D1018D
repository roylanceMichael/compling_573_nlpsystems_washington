in a scene that seemed to sum up every bizarre aspect of the investigation and press frenzy -- TV crews chased Paulus Van Der Sloot, a judge, and the father of one of four detained suspects in the case, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17.
including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who later were detained, she said.
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
