Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
Three suspects -- Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, the son of a prominent judicial official, and brothers Satish Kalpoe, 18, and Deepak Kalpoe, 21 -- are still being held and are now the focus of an intensifying investigation into the disappearance of the girl.
Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is training to be a judge in Aruba.
In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bearman said Aruban authorities couldn't be faulted completely for failing to identify van der Sloot and the others more quickly, something she said the amateur sleuths did in less than three hours in Aruba.
