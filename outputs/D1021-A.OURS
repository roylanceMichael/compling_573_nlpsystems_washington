MSNBC host Joe Scarborough personified the media paradox this week, railing
against the plea deal while perpetuating the news coverage that
helped seal it."He did not from the get go want to harm Debra
Lafave. This was someone that he liked," Sinacore said.Fitzgibbons said the judge indicated that he wanted to hear expert information
about a trial's potential impact on the two boys involved.Still, there's little doubt the plea deal avoided a trial which
could have brought a bigger media circus than even the
Terri Schiavo case.
