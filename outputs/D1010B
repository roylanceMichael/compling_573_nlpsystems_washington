Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.
The EU said the program was one of 82 programs tackling 10 major animal diseases, including rabies, mad cow, and scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease found in sheep.
EU governments have made fighting animal diseases a top priority after the mad cow crisis and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks over the last decade across Europe.
A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
In the mid 1990s the British government announced a probable link between BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form of mad cow disease, which can cause personality change, loss of body function, and eventually death.
