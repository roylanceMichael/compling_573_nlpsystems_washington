Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
The pirates were taking the captured tanker and crew to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl, Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said.
According to the US navy, the tanker- which is as big as three soccer fields - is the largest ship ever seized by pirates and the hijacking was the farthest out to sea Somali bandits have attacked a vessel.
