Three giant pandas living in Beijing Zoo will be sent to Wolong of Sichuan Province, southwest China, Wednesday and three others in Sichuan will fly to Beijing Friday, under an exchange program aimed to maintain the biodiversity of the giant panda population.
They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the region over recent years.
Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located.
