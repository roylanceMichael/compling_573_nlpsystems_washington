Environment Minister Ian Campbell said Australia was "prepared 
to raise this at levels that it's never been raised before."Howard noted in his letter that some 1.6 million tourists flock 
to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year.The Australian government on Friday 
foiled a court bid by international animal rights activists to stop 
a Japanese company from killing whales inside the country's 
Antarctic sanctuary.He said the government had not taken strong enough steps to stop Japanese
whaling companies from operating in Australian waters.The estimated 2,000 tonnes of meat currently obtained from each 
year's cull ends up in supermarkets and restaurants across Japan.New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter said he was prepared "to explore
any avenue ... if we can stop Japan slaughtering these whales."
