Light from the sun converts a chemical in our skin into vitamin D, and further conversions in the liver and kidney make the most active form of the vitamin: vitamin D3.
Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and is made in the body because sunlight's UV rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin.
Experts reviewing the study focused on vitamin D as the powerful agent in the combo group, but it can't be ruled out that calcium might somehow amplify the effect of vitamin D.
