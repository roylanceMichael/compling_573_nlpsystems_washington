The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
Conservation of tropical rain forest will be another major topic for the meeting, Angola's Deputy Minister of Agriculture Zacarias Sambeny announced here today.
