A U.N. agriculture agency called Wednesday for the rehabilitation of mangroves damaged by the Asian tsunami, saying the move would help speed up recovery in areas affected by the devastating tidal waves.
The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world.
Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
