The mangrove islet of Campbell Bay is one of hundreds in the archipelago, some partly or fully reserved for aborigines.
But in Pichavaram _ covered with 2,220 acres (900 hectares) of mangrove forests _ the local residents continue to fish just as they did before the tsunami.
To avoid tsunami, people should neither reside in the areas close to coastlines nor destroy mangrove forests that protect tidal waves, he said from the agency's compound in Bandung, West Java.
Up to half of the world's mangrove swamps have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts, transport infrastructure and commercial prawn fishing, Cripps said in a telephone interview.
Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world.
