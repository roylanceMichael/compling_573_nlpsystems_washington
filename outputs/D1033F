President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
South Korea's envoy to the United States has offered his resignation, bowing to pressure over his alleged involvement in a major political slush fund scandal, officials said Tuesday.
South Korea's spy agency publicly apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.
