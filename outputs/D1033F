South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping," National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to reporters.
South Korean prosecutors said Thurday they have secured an arrest warrant for a former intelligence official accused of leaking a taped conversation detailing a slush fund payment by the Samsung Group.
Samsung, preparing legal action against the network, apologized to the nation on Monday, expressing regret that "social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused to the Korean people" over the reports of the tape.
