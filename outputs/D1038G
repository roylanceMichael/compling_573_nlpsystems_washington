Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
Explosions from the crater could occur without warning, possibly throwing rock onto the flanks of the volcano, the USGS said in a news release.
About 20 minutes after Friday's eruption, the mountain calmed and the plume began to dissipate.
That could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was quieting down.
Seismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking Mount St. Helens for the past week and a half.
Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles below, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.
