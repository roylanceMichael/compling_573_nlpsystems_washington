Lots of people here remember well how racked with fear they were in the weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on this tiny town.
The eruption occurred at 12:03 p.m., when there was a small explosion, followed by the steam and ash cloud that rose from the southern edge of a 1,000-foot (305-meter)-tall lava dome in the volcano's crater.
Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000-foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
Volcano experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of Mount St. Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area grew.
Few people live near the mountain, the centerpiece of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Seattle.
