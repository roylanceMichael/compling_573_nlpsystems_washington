Explosions from the crater could occur without warning, possibly throwing rock onto the flanks of the volcano, the USGS said in a news release.
Officials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the crater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be affected if large amounts of ash became airborne.
Once scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be imminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles from the crater.
