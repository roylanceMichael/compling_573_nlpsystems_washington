The principal came onto Chatfield's public address system and urged students to wear ``more moderate clothes both in school and when you go out,'' Ms. Bernside said.
Two days earlier, a massacre by two students at Columbine High, whose teams are called the Rebels, left 15 people dead and dozens wounded.
The school's marquee proclaimed ``Rebels our thoughts are with you.''
Columbine is about three miles away.
The killers at Columbine wore black trench coats.
