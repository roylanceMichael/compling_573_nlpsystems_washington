To prepare for the resumption of classes, some of Columbine's 158 teachers met Tuesday morning for the first time since two student gunmen fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher before taking their own lives.
Wells, a 16-year-old catcher on Columbine's varsity baseball team, watched the junior varsity play Arvada West High School on Wednesday.
There were cheers and grins here, eight days after teen-age gunmen walked the halls of their school and killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves.
