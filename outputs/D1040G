Not only did Blake have the opportunity to kill her, but he had motive, Samuels said, casting Bakley as a small-time scam artist who had tricked Blake -- who considered himself a streetwise tough guy -- into marriage by getting pregnant.
Levenson noted that Blake, 71, not only faces life if convicted of murder, but up to nine years if jurors find him guilty on the other charge, solicitation to murder.
Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May 2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined.
She had been convicted of fraud, ran a mail-order pornography business and, over his objections, bore his now 4-year-old daughter, Rosie.
