Not only did Blake have the opportunity to kill her, but he had motive, Samuels said, casting Bakley as a small-time scam artist who had tricked Blake -- who considered himself a streetwise tough guy -- into marriage by getting pregnant.
Blake, who is free on $1.5 million (euro1.14 million) bail, is charged with one count of murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait.
Robert Blake starred in such films as "In Cold Blood" and in TV shows like "Baretta," but he couldn't pull off the role of a distraught husband, a prosecutor told jurors during closing arguments in the actor's murder trial.
In the Blake trial, each attorney has displayed a distinctive style of humor while vying for the hearts and minds of the jury.
"They convicted Mr. Blake on the night of the murder and then they conducted an incompetent investigation," defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach said.
