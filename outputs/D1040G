Samuels cited testimony that Blake tried to have Bakley arrested and her pregnancy aborted so that he would not have to marry her.The prosecutor said that in the story Cole McLarty stated that Blake had talked of Bakley and "he didn't like Bonny, didn't approve of her lifestyle and wanted her out of the way."He said another key prosecution witness, former "Baretta" stuntman and admitted cocaine user Gary McLarty, testified that Blake never asked him to kill anybody, adding that he had "assumed" that was what the actor wanted.Samuels laid out a timeline for jurors in which she said Blake went to elaborate lengths to try to have Bakley arrested before their Nov. 19, 2000, wedding so he wouldn't have to marry her.The jurors must decide if Blake pulled the trigger, which would put him in prison for the rest of his life, and if he solicited the two stuntmen, each count carrying a maximum penalty of nine years.Blake ambushed his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, killing her after several other people refused to do the job for him, prosecutor Shellie Samuels argued.Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake never directly asked to kill his wife.The prosecution had argued earlier that Blake despised his wife, and when he could not get anyone else to kill her, he pulled he trigger himself.Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors Thursday that they should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who have lied to authorities."They convicted Mr. Blake on the night of the murder and then they conducted an incompetent investigation," defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach said.``There is no direct evidence -- none, zero, zippo -- that Mr. Blake killed Bonny Bakley,'' he told jurors in a San Fernando Valley courtroomNot only did Blake have the opportunity to kill her, but he had motive, Samuels said, casting Bakley as a small-time scam artist who had tricked Blake -- who considered himself a streetwise tough guy -- into marriage by getting pregnant.Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the lawyer said.During his daylong summation of the two-month trial, M. Gerald Schwartzbach also disputed the accounts of several prosecution witnesses that Blake acted oddly the night his wife was killed, and denied that his client was acting when he wailed and moaned at the crime scene.Both stuntmen changed their statements about the details of the solicitations, including the type and color of the gun Blake showed them, whether Blake offered money for a hit and possible locations to carry out the slaying.But Samuels told jurors that if Blake really wanted to protect his wife he never would have left her alone in a car parked on a dark street.
