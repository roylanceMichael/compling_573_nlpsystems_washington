The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
During the murder trial of Robert Blake, the public has been privy to one bizarre scenario after another, grist for a true-life pulp novel.
Blake, who is free on $1.5 million (euro1.14 million) bail, is charged with one count of murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait.
The prosecutor in the Robert Blake murder trial urged jurors Wednesday to ignore his celebrity, then derided his acting abilities by saying he overplayed his role as a grieving spouse.
Not only did Blake have the opportunity to kill her, but he had motive, Samuels said, casting Bakley as a small-time scam artist who had tricked Blake -- who considered himself a streetwise tough guy -- into marriage by getting pregnant.
