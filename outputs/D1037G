In the 1970s and '80s, before diseases started their rampant spread through the bay, the average harvest reported to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources was more than 2 million bushels.
The study, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is intended to guide the governors of Virginia and Maryland as they decide whether to allow the oyster Crassostrea ariakensis@ to reproduce in the Chesapeake.
About 90 percent of Maryland's crab meat is produced by plants using H-2B workers, said Douglas Lipton, a professor of resource management at the University of Maryland.
Maryland officials responded Wednesday that they would not make any moves before they were sure the new oyster is safe.
