Ren Yuling, a member of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the top political advisory body, said earlier the current punishments are often too slack to deter those involved in large-scale food safety accidents.
The plan, issued by the State Council, or the country's cabinet, said by 2010 the food safety information monitoring network will cover 90 percent of the country.
Last year China experienced a string of food safety problems including steroid- tainted pork, parasite-infested snails, turbots that contain excessive amount of carcinogens, and ducks that were fed cancer-causing dye to make their egg yolks red.
