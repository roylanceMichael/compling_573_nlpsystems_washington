Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
According to the US navy, the tanker -- which is as big as three soccer fields -- is the largest ship ever seized by pirates and the hijacking was the farthest out to sea Somali bandits have attacked a vessel.
The pirates were taking the captured tanker and crew to an anchorage off the Somali port of Eyl, Lt. Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said.
The hijacking follows a string of increasingly brazen attacks by Somali pirates in recent months, but this appeared to be first time they have seized an oil tanker.
