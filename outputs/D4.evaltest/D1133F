A burning car was driven at the front of the main terminal building at Glasgow Airport, at around 3:15 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The links related to the way the foiled car-bomb attacks in London and the airport attack in Glasgow had been conceived and planned using vehicles and gasoline, the official said.
Peter Clarke, deputy assistant commissioner of the anti-terrorism branch at the Metropolitan Police, said the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to the incident in London.
Britain's senior police officer said here on Saturday night that the attack at Glasgow airport was linked to events in London where two car bombs were defused on Friday.
