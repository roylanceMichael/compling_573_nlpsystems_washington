Because of deficiency concerns, the current recommendations for vitamin D -- 200 international units for people up to age 50; 400 IUs for those 51 to 70; and 600 IUs for those older -- may be changing, says Judy Carr, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator.
Light from the sun converts a chemical in our skin into vitamin D, and further conversions in the liver and kidney make the most active form of the vitamin: vitamin D3.
Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin that is found in food and is made in the body because sunlight's UV rays trigger vitamin D synthesis in the skin.
The role of vitamin D in chronic disease is unclear, but the vitamin is needed for strong bones and to regulate cell growth.
