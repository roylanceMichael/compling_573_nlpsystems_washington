Since 2001, China has spent billions of yuan planting trees, converting marginal farmland to forest and grasslands and fighting soil erosion.
Soil erosion is deteriorating in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as excessive herding and farming have outpaced the government's conservation efforts.
China will encourage its farmers to use more environmentally-friendly fertilizers and pesticides to reduce pollution of the soil, rivers and lakes, according to the document, which is the year's first major policy paper jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
China's hillside farm areas lose 1.5 billion tons of soil annually, about a third of the nation's total soil loss each year, said Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping on Friday.
