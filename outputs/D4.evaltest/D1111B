Flags hung at half-mast across Finland on Thursday as a show of mourning for the victims of the Jokela school shooting.
A teenager at a school in Finland went on the rampage Wednesday, shooting dead seven classmates and the headmistress, having first signalled his intentions in a video posted on the YouTube Internet site.
The shooting took place in Jokela High School in Tuusula, some 50 kilometers north of Helsinki, the capital of Finland on Wednesday.
Finland has one of the world's highest gun ownership rates, ranking third behind the United States and Yemen according to a recent study by Small Arms Survey by the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.
