NATO has four ships -- from Britain, Greece, Italy and Turkey -- on patrol in the waters off Somalia, with two protecting UN food aid convoys to the strife- torn Horn of Africa country.
Sirius Star, which is owned by Saudi Aramco, carried 25 crew members from Croatia, Britain, Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia, according to a US Navy statement.
The Saudi tanker, however, was seized far to the south of the patrolled zone, about 450 nautical miles (833 kilometers) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, according the U.S. Navy.
