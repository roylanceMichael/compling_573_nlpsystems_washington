"Because Savannah's on the coast, where the temperature's more moderate, oh boy, that's where I get worried," said Steve Johnson, a University of Florida ecologist who tracks the spread of Cuban tree frogs.Cricket frogs, once abundant, declined dramatically around Chicago and other regions in the 1960s, and the scientists found that the times and places with high rates of hermaphrodites, also called intersexes, overlapped with when and where the frogs disappeared in Illinois.Scientists say amphibians serve as sentinels for environmental problems that might be jeopardizing entire ecosystems.The scientists theorize that DDT, industrial compounds called PCBs, and other contaminants had an anti-estrogenic effect, reducing the proportion of females and causing them to develop skewed sex organs, triggering a population crash, particularly in the Chicago region."If people encounter them, they can kill them and send us the actual animal or they can take photos," Jensen said.Scientists believe that the phenomenon has been occurring for decades but wasn't documented in wildlife until the early 1990s, when it was observed first in Florida alligators and then many other species.Scientists say the survey is bad news for humans, too.Scientists suspect a variety of factors, including the spread of a deadly fungus that may have originated in Africa, global climate change, or a combination.Frogs are considered a key sentinel for effects of environmental degradation because they undergo a vulnerable time of metamorphosis and spend most of their time in water, where pollutants accumulate.Scientists say the rate of extinction is so rapid that the report probably underestimates the numbers threatened.Scientists who compared frogs collected over the past 150 years have discovered a dramatic increase in hermaphrodites during the times when contamination from the pesticide DDT and other organochlorine chemicals was widespread.In the last 11 years, Yanacocha independently financed the construction of 35 schools, built miles (kilometers) of road and brought electricity and drinking water to remote communities, Hock said, adding the company has poured tens of millions of dollars into Cajamarca's economy through local suppliers to the mine.The findings of more than 500 scientists were included in the first-ever global amphibian assessment, a three-year effort by researchers with IUCN-The World Conservation Union, the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science of Conservation International and NatureServe.Scientists began noticing the disappearance of amphibians in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but before this study they'd never conducted a worldwide assessment of the frogs, toads, salamanders and legless caecilians, also called rubber eels."It starts us thinking that we should be paying attention to these because parallel things could happen in humans," Hammerson said.``This is the first group being affected by a death by a thousand cuts in the way that we as humans have been affecting the biosphere in the past fifty or hundred years,'' said Claude Gascon, a scientific adviser to the study who serves as vice president for regional programs at Conservation International, an environmental group
