The 17-year-old plane -- on a two-hour flight from East Java to Manado, on Sulawesi's northern tip -- carried six crew and 96 passengers, including 11 children.
It was the worst air disaster since Sept. 5, 2005, when a Mandala Airline's Boeing 737-200 crashed shortly after taking off from the North Sumatra's airport, killing 103 people onboard and 47 others on the ground.
At least 90 people, including five TNI AL members, were killed in the crash.
