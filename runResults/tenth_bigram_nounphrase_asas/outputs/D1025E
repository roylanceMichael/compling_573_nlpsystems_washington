Servheen of the Fish and Wildlife Service who is a strong advocate of delisting the Yellowstone grizzlies dismissed the resolutions as ''colorful but meaningless,`` saying that ''a majority of people want bears around.
Before delisting can occur, state and federal agencies in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho must establish bear management plans.
Craig Manson, assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks at the Interior Department, said the agency considers Yellowstone's grizzly population, which has rebounded from a low of roughly 200 in 1982 to more than 600 today, ``recovered.
A draft proposal to take the grizzlies off the endangered species list went out this summer from field offices of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
