All five factions of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest legislative body, agreed to add a provision in a decree on clean governance, preventing centralization of power, corruption, collusion and nepotism.
Addressing a plenary meeting on Wednesday, Golkar spokesperson Marwah Daud Ibrahim said the implementation of a clean government, with no traces of corruption, collusion and nepotism, is a prerequisite to achievement of the aims of the 1945 proclamation.
Students and citizens in the country have held various demonstrations recently, urging the government to bring Soeharto to court on the charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism during his 32-year rule.
He said many senior officials such as ministers, governors, regents and mayors also had amassed wealth through corruption, collusion and nepotism during Soeharto's 32 years in power.
