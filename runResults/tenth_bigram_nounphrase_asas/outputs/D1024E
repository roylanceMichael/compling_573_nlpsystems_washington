The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S. Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es-Salaam two weeks ago.
U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
