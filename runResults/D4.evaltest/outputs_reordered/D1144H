Much of the rise in China's ranking on the recall list has to do with its corresponding surge as the source of so many products sold in the United States: Toys made in China make up 70 to 80 percent of the toys sold in the country, according to the Toy Industry Association.
But just in the last month, a so-called Floating Eyeballs toy made in China was recalled after it was found to be filled with kerosene, sets of toy drums and a toy bear were also recalled because of lead paint and an infant wrist rattle was recalled because of a choking hazard.
