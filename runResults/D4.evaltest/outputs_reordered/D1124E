The government will shift the track, which currently runs very close to the mud volcano zone, four kilometres (more than two miles) from its present location.
A mud volcano that has erupted in Indonesia, forcing the evacuation of thousands of villagers, was most probably caused by drilling for gas, according to the first published scientific study into the phenomenon.
A leading Indonesian environmental group has filed a suit against President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and an energy firm on mud flow that has damaged environment and displaced more than 10,000 people in Java Island, the group's chairman said here on Tuesday.
It adds that the volcano has been disgorging between 7,000 and 150,000 cubic metres (245,000 and 5.25 million cubic feet) of mud every day.
