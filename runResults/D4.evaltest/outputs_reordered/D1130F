Ferries are a crucial link between the archipelago nation's 17,000 islands and frequently carry more people than officially acknowledged.
The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of 850 people, but the transport minister earlier said it had 638 people on board based on the manifest.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged rescue teams to keep up the hunt for survivors of the ferry accident.
The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.
Weeping relatives camped out at ports and a local hospital, desperate for news of the some 400 still missing from the ferry when it sank during a violent storm minutes before midnight Friday.
