The trial opens Thursday of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the Madrid train bomb attacks in March 2004, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824 in the worst terror strike Spain has ever known.
The trial, which is expected to hear evidence from more than 600 witnesses and last for some five months before an October verdict, opened amid tight security at a high court venue on the outskirts of Madrid.
Twenty Arab men and nine Spaniards face charges that range from belonging to a terrorist group to stealing dynamite to sell to the bombers as the trial opens weeks before the third anniversary of the March 11 bombings.
