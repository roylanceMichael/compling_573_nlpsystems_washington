After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling, Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that officials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained eruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.
Government scientists raised the alert level for Mount St. Helens after its second steam eruption in two days was followed by a powerful tremor.
