The Tokyo-based Organisation for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries and the World Tuna Purse Seine Organisation, headquartered in Seoul, adopted a joint statement demanding a moratorium on the use of additional large tuna vessels, officials said.
Japan eats a quarter of the world's tuna, more than any other country, but faces pressure from environmentalists, who have blamed the global fad for Japanese food for bringing tuna numbers to the brink of eventual extinction.
It is proposed by Japan and organized by the Western Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries Commission, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
