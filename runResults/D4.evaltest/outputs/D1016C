Meanwhile, a legislator claimed that President B.J Habibie needed no new law to start investigation on former president Soeharto, saying that the existing anti-corruption law would do.
In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has been found in several provinces including land, factories and others.
