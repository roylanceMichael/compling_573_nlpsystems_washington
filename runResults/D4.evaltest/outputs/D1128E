Former Liberian President Charles Taylor will not be ready for the start of his trial in June on charges of overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in West Africa, his lawyer told a judge Friday.
In the run-up to the trial Taylor's lawyers had complained that there were insufficient resources for the defence with just two attorneys versus some nine prosecution trial lawyers.
Taylor goes on trial on June 4 at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Taylor's family also accused the Special War Crimes Court in The Hague, where the ex-leader is imprisoned, of violating Taylor's right to privacy and right to legal professional privilege by installing a video surveillance camera to record conferences with his attorneys.
