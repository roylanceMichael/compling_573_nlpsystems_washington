Later in the penalty phase of the trial, Alvarez's wife, Carmen, and his brother Beto are expected to ask jurors to spare his life.
Less moving were the testimony of Alvarez's older cousin Beto Alvarez, who now is helping raise Juan's son and his adopted daughter, and his estranged wife, Carmen, the woman prosecutors say Alvarez was attempting to impress and win back when he caused the disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
Prosecutors said Alvarez had deliberately caused the accident on the Metrolink commuter line on January 26, 2005 to get attention.
