House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asked the House Armed Services Committee to conduct an investigation of outpatient care at Walter Reed.
The Post last week gave the Army six days to respond to the paper's investigation into decaying, cockroach-infested facilities and an overwhelmed patient-care bureaucracy at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Northwest Washington.
Walter Reed's fixes are unlikely to immediately quiet the drumbeat of criticism that erupted among members of Congress who received a flood of calls from the public and veterans groups asking how the problems could have been unknown to officials, some of whom visit Walter Reed on a regular basis.
