The melting snow on the western slopes of the Rockies feeds into the Colorado River to flow west and south, across parts of Colorado, Utah and Arizona, and, since the construction of the dam, into Lake Mead, some 30 miles east of Las Vegas.
The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land.
The ongoing drought has left Lake Powell and Lake Mead, the Colorado's two mammoth reservoirs, half empty, their receding shorelines marked by a wide band of bleached rocks that a decade ago were under water.
