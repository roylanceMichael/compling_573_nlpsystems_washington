The trial opens Thursday of 29 mostly Moroccan suspects charged with involvement in the Madrid train bomb attacks in March 2004, which killed 191 people and injured 1,824 in the worst terror strike Spain has ever known.
Spain raised the level of its terrorism alert on Tuesday as a precautionary measure ahead of the upcoming trial of suspects in the Madrid train bombings and the third anniversary of the attacks.
