Cyclone Sidr, described as the worst storm in years to hit low-lying and disaster-prone Bangladesh, crashed into the southwestern coast Thursday night before sweeping north over the capital Dhaka.
Tropical Cyclone Sidr, hovering over the Bay of Bengal, was moving towards Bangladesh's southern coastal districts, on the border with India, and likely to hit land later Thursday, said Bazlur Rashid of the Bangladesh weather department.
Cyclone Sidr, visible in satellite images as a huge swirling white mass over the Bay of Bengal, was also expected to unleash tidal surges of up to six metres (20 feet) in some areas.
