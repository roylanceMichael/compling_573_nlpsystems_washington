The most recent drought began in 2000 and has left the river's biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, roughly half empty.
The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land.
Water deliveries would be decreased based on how far water levels drop in Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
