Navy ships, fishermen and search and rescue teams have found more than 200 survivors since the ferry sank late Friday with some 600 people on board.
The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.
The Senopati Nusantara sank quickly after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's main island of Java.
