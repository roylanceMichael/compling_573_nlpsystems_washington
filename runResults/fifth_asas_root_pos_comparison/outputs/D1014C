About 11 percent of national men and 14 percent of women had diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years, according to the study released by UAE's medical center today.
Head of the center, William Ng Man-sui, said concern over an increasing number of young children with obesity problems had prompted him to research the eating habits of upper-grade students at all seven primary schools in Chai Wan, a district in the east of Hong Kong island.
But despite the implementation of the strategy, John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, reported that Britons' behavior is becoming worse in three areas: obesity in men and women, drinking by women and smoking by the young.
