The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.
About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for the making of chemical weapons.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
