The dwindling rain forest reserves and rapid expansion of the Sahara desert southwards pose a threat to the survival of the people in the African countries, Juma warned.
Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land.
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
