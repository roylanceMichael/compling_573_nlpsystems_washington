A ceasefire was agreed to remove the dead and wounded from the site of the day-long exchange of machinegun fire in Dera Bugti southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, officials said.
Authorities were also hunting the culprits behind the bombing of the Chiltan Express train heading from the eastern city of Lahore to Quetta, the latest in a series of attacks on the rail network in Baluchistan.
Baluchistan has been in the grip of a sporadic tribal revolt for more han a year but the violence surged after the January 2 rape of a 32-year-old doctor in her lodgings near the Sui gasfield.
