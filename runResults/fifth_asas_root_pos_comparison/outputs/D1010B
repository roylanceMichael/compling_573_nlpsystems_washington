The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
In an interview in the Bulgarian newspaper Troud, the director of Bulgaria's laboratory for detecting mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Raiko Pechev said the Dutch test was "more precise, more rapid" than tests already approved by the EU and "is in its last stage of EU pre-certification trials".
A person who donated blood several times over the past 10 years has been diagnosed as the eighth case of the human form of mad cow disease in France since the invariably fatal illness was declared a public health risk in 1996, officials said.
