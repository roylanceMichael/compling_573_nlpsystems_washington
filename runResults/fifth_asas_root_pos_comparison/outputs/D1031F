The Indonesian government Sunday sent a research vessel to the west coast of tsunami-devastated Aceh to conduct survey of the ocean floor around the zone of the earthquake on Dec. 26 last year.
According to the minister, early information and data on the condition of the seabed around the epicenter of the quake would be extremely useful for establishing an early warning system against earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption.
The Indonesian government is also sending a technology service operation team to Aceh to provide humanitarian aid and technical assistance, and in the meantime conduct surveys on seabed and damage of the coastal area along the west coast of Aceh, said Indonesian officials.
