Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
It has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
The opposition Labor Party assailed the government's intervention in the case, which coincides with efforts by Japan to gain permission from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to double the number of whales it can kill each year.
