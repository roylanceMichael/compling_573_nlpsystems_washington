"It is probably impossible to say anything until the end of next week end about the date at which the Snorre A and Vigdis (platforms) will be able to resume activity," Statoil, the operator of the two installations, said in a statement.
The Snorre field is operated by Statoil, which owns a 14.39 percent share, as well as the Norwegian state-owned group Petoro, ExxonMobil of the United States, Idemitsu Petroleum of Japan, RWE Dea of Germany, Total of France, Amerada Hess of the US and Enterprise Oil of Britain.
"Statoil thinks it will be acceptable to resume partial production from its Snorre A platform in the North Sea," the company said in a statement, adding that, "a partial start-up could take place independently of remaining work with the platform wells".
