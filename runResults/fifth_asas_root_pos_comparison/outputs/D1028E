Legal experts say Kaczynski's best hope is escaping the death penalty in the second phase of the trial, if he's convicted, on grounds that he has had lifelong mental problems.
In the first phase, jurors must determine if Kaczynski is the bomber who terrorized the country for 17 years, beginning in 1978.
Kaczynski is the suspect of the mailing-bomb terrorist who has killed three people and injured 23 others in the 18 years.
Justice Department sources said Reno agreed to prosecutors' request and had authorized the death penalty in the case, and said the decision was expected to be disclosed in a court filing later on Thursday in Sacramento, California, where the case is pending.
