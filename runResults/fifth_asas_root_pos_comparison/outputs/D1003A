The rarity of the bamboo-chomping bears, along with the variety and beauty of the area's landscape and ecology, were cited as reasons for the application to the UN, the Shanghai Morning Post said.
Giant pandas used to live in Fengxian County before the 1970s but later disappeared from the area owing to the construction of the railway from Baoqi in Shaanxi to the capital city of Chengdu in southwestern Sichuan province.
The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said.
