The cow was born in Shikaoi, north Japan's Hokkaido region, in October 2000, and was checked for mad cow disease after it died, the ministry said.
A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease, especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
EU governments have made fighting animal diseases a top priority after the mad cow crisis and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks over the last decade across Europe.
