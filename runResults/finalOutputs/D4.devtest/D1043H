Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
Wailing and shouting, hundreds of thousands of mourners made their way in a somber but angry procession Wednesday from the home of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to his burial place in the grounds of an unfinished mosque that was one of his favorite reconstruction projects.
