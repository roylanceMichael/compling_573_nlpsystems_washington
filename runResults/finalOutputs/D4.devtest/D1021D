Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
The victim's mother said afterward that the public scrutiny had taken its toll on the family, and they just wanted to see it all end.
Former Greco Middle School teacher Debra Lafave, arrested last year amid allegations she had an affair with a student, is scheduled to stand trial in December on two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
No matter where she goes, life will not be the same for Debra Lafave.
