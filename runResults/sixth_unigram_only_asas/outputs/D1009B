When John and Patsy Ramsey hired lawyers after their daughter, JonBenet, was killed and then distanced themselves from police, it didn't sit right with Nancy Gordon.
Ramsey said that when he was told that police had tried to withhold his daughter's body for burial in order to force an interrogation, he lost all confidence in them, the reporters wrote.
On Thursday, Boulder's new police chief, Mark Beckner, urged the prosecutor to convene a grand jury for the case.
The Ramseys now live in Atlanta.
The Newsweek reporters wrote that the Ramseys displayed a range of emotions in the interview in the two-story home in suburban Atlanta where they moved after JonBenet's death.
