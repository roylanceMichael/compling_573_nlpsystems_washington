Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30 months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over 24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.
The hospital said last month the young man had never received or made a blood donation and the cause of the infection was not linked to an operation.
