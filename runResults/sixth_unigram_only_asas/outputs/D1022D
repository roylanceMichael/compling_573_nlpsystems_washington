Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in the name of scientific research.
Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
