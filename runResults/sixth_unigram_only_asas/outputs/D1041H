Lyle Vail, director of the Lizard Island Research Station on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, said damage to coral reefs from a tsunami would likely be similar to that from a cyclone.
Wreckage of the Amorgos, a Greek freighter that ran aground and sank off the coast of Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan. 14, 2001, is now "a slaughter hell" for coral in an area of Lungkeng off Kenting, said Cheng Ming-hsiu, Society chairman and a researcher with Academia Sinica's Institute of Zoology.
The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities.
