England went on to say she had deliberately done wrong in posing for other pictures, including one that showed seven naked prisoners forced to form a human pyramid.
- On October 23, 2003, England held a strap around an Iraqi detainee's neck as he crawled naked on the ground.
Of the seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company charged in the abuse scandal, four have previously entered guilty pleas, and the only soldier to stand trial so far was Charles Graner, who was serving a 10-year jail term.
The others previously convicted:
"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the background of being a corrections officer," said England, who pled guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in October and November 2003.
