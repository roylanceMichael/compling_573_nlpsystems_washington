When the Vancouver couple got to within five miles (eight kilometers) of the Johnston Ridge Observatory on Friday, they pulled to the side of the road and saw what they had been coming for: an ashen-white cloud billowing from the volcano's crater.
Scientists on Saturday saw an increase of fumaroles, a hole from which hot gases and vapors emanate, in St. Helens' lava dome and detected carbon dioxide, the USGS said.
"All this suggests that a second eruption is imminent," said USGS spokeswoman Catherine Puckett.
"We don't know where it is," said William Steele, a seismologist at the University of Washington.
