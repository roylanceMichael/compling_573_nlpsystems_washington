Chief of the Prosecutor's Office in Irian Jaya Province T.H. Sidabutar said they were also investigating thousands of hectares of land allegedly belonging to Soeharto, his children and cronies.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
