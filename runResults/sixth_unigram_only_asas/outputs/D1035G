The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
Evidence of diabetes' link to use of herbicides or dioxin is listed by the study as still ``inadequate or insufficient'' to draw an association with Agent Orange or other chemicals used in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971.
``A lot more research is being done, which we are very optimistic will continue to provide useful information to answer the questions that remain,'' said Dr. David Tollerud, who directed the study and heads the Center for Environmental and Occupation Health at Hahnemann University School of Public Health in Philadelphia
