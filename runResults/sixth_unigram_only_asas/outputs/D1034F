Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat, according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
"The frogs, ducks and trout we used to have in the Rio Grande are gone," said Segundo Briones, a community leader, referring to one of three rivers that drop down from the mining operations.
Isolated reports of silent forests and empty streams began to circulate about three decades ago, but the latest assessment is the first to provide a complete snapshot of a global decline in the diversity of frogs, salamanders, newts, and worm-like caecilians, and to show that they are at greater risk than both birds and mammals.
