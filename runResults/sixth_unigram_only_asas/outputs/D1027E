Henderson and the 21-year-old McKinney both face the death penalty if convicted in a case that has become a central focus for gay rights activists and others seeking stronger bias crime legislation.
Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a fence in the cold.
Skaggs also told the jury candidates that the case ``is not about lifestyles.
``There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening.
``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?
