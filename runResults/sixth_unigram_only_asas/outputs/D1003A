Initial studies have found that pandas have different blood types, but researchers have not conducted in-depth studies and lack sufficient knowledge about this, centre deputy chief engineer Huang Yan said.
The nature preserve, occupying about 220,000 hectares, has 102 giant pandas living wild.
Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China.
More than 1,500 giant pandas live wild in China, with Sichuan home to 76 percent of them, according to the State Forestry Administration.
They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the region over recent years.
