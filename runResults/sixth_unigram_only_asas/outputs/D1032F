"It is probably impossible to say anything until the end of next week end about the date at which the Snorre A and Vigdis (platforms) will be able to resume activity," Statoil, the operator of the two installations, said in a statement.
Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short term.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
