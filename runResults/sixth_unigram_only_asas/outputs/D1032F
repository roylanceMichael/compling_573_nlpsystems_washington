"We are trying to seal the leak so that we can resume production as early as possible," he said.
Statoil also said it submitted a report on its progress in sealing the well to the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Tuesday, and that resuming crude oil flows also depends on the authority giving the go-ahead.
Statoil pumped cement into the production well to permanently cap it and prevent any further leaks.
Three helicopters and four ships were helping evacuate the rest of the staff, Norwegian news agency NTB said.
