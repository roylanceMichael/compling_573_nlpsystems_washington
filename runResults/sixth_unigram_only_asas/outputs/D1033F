MBC, a major local broadcasting company, released parts of an eavesdropped conversation in which Hong allegedly discussed with a senior Samsung Group official to donate slush fund to candidate of the Grand National Party (GNP) Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 presidential election.
South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
The potentially explosive case came to light when a tape of a wiretapped conversation in 1997 between Hong and a top Samsung official was leaked to the press last week.
