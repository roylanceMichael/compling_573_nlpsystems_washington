Experts estimate that around 100 tons of pollutants containing benzene has flown into the Songhua River, caused by a Nov. 13 explosion at an upstream chemical plant of the Jilin Petrochemical Company under the China National Petroleum Corp.
Songhua River will carry poisonous substances to Harbin, a major city in northeast China, at round 5:00 a.m. Thursday, an official said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.
The operation of the city's water supply system was temporarily resumed on Wednesday afternoon following a forecast by China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) that the polluted water will not reach the city until Thursday.
