Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said.
He said that the conference will invite 23 countries, including the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and four major international organisations.
Bangladesh would airlift and ship 1, 000 metric tons of high energy biscuits (HEB) for the tsunami victims of Indonesia and Sri Lanka this week.
The two batches of relief goods, worth 21.63 million yuan (2.62 million US dollars), are mainly tents, blankets, sheets and food that are badly needed by the people affected by the tsunami.
