Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties from the province's natural resources.
Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations.
A ceasefire was agreed to remove the dead and wounded from the site of the day-long exchange of machinegun fire in Dera Bugti southeast of the provincial capital Quetta, officials said.
