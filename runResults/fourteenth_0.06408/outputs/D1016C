Soeharto's fortune, part of which has been sold to his crony and noted businessman Prayogo Pangestu, reportedly comprised stocks, land, a plywood factory, a bank, a pineapple cannery and a TV relay station, worth 122.4 billion rupiah (15.3 million U.S. dollars) in all.
A prominent crony, Bob Hasan, for instance, apparently held a virtual monopoly on the supply of vegetables, meat, eggs, fruits and various other necessities for employees of PT Freeport Indonesia mining firm in Irian Jaya.
