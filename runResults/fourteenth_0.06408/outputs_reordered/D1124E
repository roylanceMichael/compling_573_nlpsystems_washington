Experts have failed to curb or channel the mud to the sea.
A mud volcano that has erupted in Indonesia, forcing the evacuation of thousands of villagers, was most probably caused by drilling for gas, according to the first published scientific study into the phenomenon.
A leading Indonesian environmental group has filed a suit against President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and an energy firm on mud flow that has damaged environment and displaced more than 10,000 people in Java Island, the group's chairman said here on Tuesday.
