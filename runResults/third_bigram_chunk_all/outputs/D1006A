The Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts who raised safety concerns weeks before Merck &amp; Co. yanked the blockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and strokes, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Thursday.
Momentum was growing for a fresh look at the safety of Celebrex and other pain relievers as key researchers, a congressman and European regulators said they feared such drugs might raise the risk of heart problems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.
Seven weeks before Merck &amp; Co. pulled the arthritis drug Vioxx off the market because of safety concerns, federal drug regulators downplayed the significance of scientific findings citing the increased risks, documents released Thursday show.
