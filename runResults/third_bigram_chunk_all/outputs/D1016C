In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
The office of Indonesia's attorney general has formed a team to investigate the wealth of present and former Indonesian government officials, a spokesman of the office said here Tuesday.
Local people and students in Indonesia's capital Jakarta held an anti-Soeharto mass demonstration, starting at 14:00 local time on Thursday.
