The day that Columbine High School   students are to return to class has been delayed because so many  have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20  massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
The sheriff's initial estimate of as   many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark  apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building  counted some victims more than once.
They streamed in from all over --   hand-lettered signs and cards and bouquets by the hundreds, aimed  at comforting a town torn asunder.
Columbine High School junior Matt Wells   took time out from the grieving world around him to crack a smile,  chew on a wad of sunflower seeds and talk a little baseball.
