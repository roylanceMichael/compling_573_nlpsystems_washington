After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling, Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that officials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained eruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.
Mount St. Helens, the volcano that blew its top with cataclysmic force in 1980, erupted for the first time in 18 years Friday, belching a huge column of white steam and ash after days of rumblings.
Just before noon on Friday, seismometers at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., wiggled in a familiar pattern.
Lots of people here remember well how racked with fear they were in the weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on this tiny town.
