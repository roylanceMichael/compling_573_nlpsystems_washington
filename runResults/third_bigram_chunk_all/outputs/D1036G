The United States on Monday urged the Ukrainian government to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
"We have provided assistance to organizations supporting such a process in Ukraine, and that includes NGOs, as well as other international organizations, but that's to assist in voter education and political party training, and it is also assistance which is made available to all political parties in Ukraine."
The illness that disfigured the face of opposition presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna on Saturday.
