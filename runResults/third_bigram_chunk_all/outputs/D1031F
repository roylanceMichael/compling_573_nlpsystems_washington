The Indonesian Volcanic and Geological Disaster Mitigation Directorate (DVMBG) said on Friday 28 areas in the country are prone to tsunami tidal waves and called on local administrations and people to stay alert for such natural disasters.
Beaches around South Asia devastated by tsunamis could be restored to their former glory within a few years, but the marine life through which the huge waves passed could take centuries to recover, experts said.
Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.
