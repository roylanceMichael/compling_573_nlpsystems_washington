LaFave was accused of lewd acts with a child in several sexual encounters in the Hillsborough County school, in her car, and in the house that she had with her husband, in neighboring Ocala County.
The tapes, broadcast over local television, recorded LaFave, 24, arranging an encounter with the youth, while expressing concern that he not lie to his mother, Tampa prosecutors said.
If I were on a jury and a lawyer argued his client should not go to prison because he or she was beautiful, I would be offended.
But whether deliberate or automatic, Fitzgibbons' argument was precisely that Lafave should not be subjected to prison because she is beautiful.
