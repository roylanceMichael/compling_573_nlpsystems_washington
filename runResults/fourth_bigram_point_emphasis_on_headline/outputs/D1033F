Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he  might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest  conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush  funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday said he will accept the resignation of South Korea's ambassador to the United States, who is stepping down over a burgeoning scandal surrounding the East Asian country's 1997 presidential election.
MBC, a major local broadcasting company, released parts of an  eavesdropped conversation in which Hong allegedly discussed with a senior Samsung Group official to donate slush fund to candidate of the Grand National Party (GNP) Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997  presidential election.
