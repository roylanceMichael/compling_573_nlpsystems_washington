Hunter ``has provided evidence to Ramsey defense attorneys at their request'' but denied requests by other witnesses for transcripts of their own statements to the police, wrote Fleet and Priscilla White, a couple who had the Ramsey family to their home for dinner on Dec. 25, 1996, a few hours before JonBenet was found dead.
``The American public has been led to believe that, after a wonderful Christmas, we brutally beat JonBenet, sexually molested her, strangled her, went to sleep, got up the next morning, wrote a ransom note, called the police, sat around the house for four hours, then I went downstairs and discovered her body and was able to act distraught,'' Ramsey said.
