Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure  seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday  after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in  the name of scientific research.
Japan announced in early April it intends to seek permission to conduct a "broader and more comprehensive" research whaling program in the Antarctic at the commission's annual meeting in South Korea in mid-June.
