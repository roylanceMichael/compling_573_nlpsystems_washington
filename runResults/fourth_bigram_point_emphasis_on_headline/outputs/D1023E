Places like Davos, Switzerland, where the high and mighty of the worlds of government, industry and finance congregated at a conference early this month, are now inaccessible by road or rail, and others, like the fashionable Austrian resorts of Lech and Zuers, another 60 miles west of here, have been cut off for more than a week.
An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing, in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow disaster in years.
So Mrs. Schwarz, her daughter, Solvieg, and her son, Christoph, were relaxing in bed on the third floor of their bed-and-breakfast chalet in the center of Galtuer at 4 p.m. Tuesday when, with an almighty rumbling, clouds of snow blasted through the windows and the whole house collapsed beneath them.
