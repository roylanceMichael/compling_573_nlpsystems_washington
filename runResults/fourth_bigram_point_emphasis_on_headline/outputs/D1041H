Over the past three decades, Taiwan has created a large number of artificial reefs made from discarded utility poles, decommissioned naval vessels and discarded tires at 100-plus designated areas along the coastline to enhance fishery resources.
Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
Beaches around South Asia devastated by tsunamis could be restored to their former glory within a few years, but the marine life through which the huge waves passed could take centuries to recover, experts said.
