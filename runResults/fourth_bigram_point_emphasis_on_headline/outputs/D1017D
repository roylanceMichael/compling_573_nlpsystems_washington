Tropical storm Floyd strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United States.
A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that   Floyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous  Category 4 storm.
From as far south as Miami to as far north as Cape Canaveral, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated the densely populated Florida coast as the storm, with winds of more than 155 mph, crept westward across the Atlantic and forecasters' radar screens.
