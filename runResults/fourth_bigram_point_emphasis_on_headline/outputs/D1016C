Soeharto, in a speech on the channel controlled by his eldest daughter Siti Hardijanti Rukmana on Sunday, said: "The fact is, I don't have even one cent of savings abroad, don't have accounts at foreign banks... let alone hundreds of billion of dollars."
addressing a gathering on Sunday at the Bogor Institute of Agriculture in Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of the capital, Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais has asked Soeharto to donate his wealth to the nation and also called on Indonesians to forgive the former president who had made great contribution to the country.
In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
