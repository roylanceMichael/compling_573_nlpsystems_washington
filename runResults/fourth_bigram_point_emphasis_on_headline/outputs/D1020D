Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and cold cuts.
The Department of Agriculture has the power to bar imported meat and poultry, but in a report issued in May, the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said ``Federal agencies cannot ensure that the growing volume of imported food is safe for consumers,'' and recommended that the power of equivalency be extended to cover all foods eligible for import.
