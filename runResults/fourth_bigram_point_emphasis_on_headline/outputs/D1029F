Seventeen minority Hindus were killed when their temple was hit by rockets during fighting between renegade tribesmen and security forces in a restive tribal town in southwestern Pakistan last week, a government official said Monday.
Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of residents to flee for safety, an official said Sunday.
Nawab Akbar Bugti, the chief of Bugti tribe in Dera Bugti, claimed that hundreds of his armed supporters have taken up positions on mountains near the town and they were ready to face the security forces.
