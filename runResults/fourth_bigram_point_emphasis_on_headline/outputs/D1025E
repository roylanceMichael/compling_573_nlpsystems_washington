The Yellowstone grizzly bear, one of the first and most controversial animals to be protected by the Endangered Species Act, is fully recovered, and it is time to remove the stringent safeguards it has had for nearly three decades, federal officials said on Tuesday.
A formidable symbol of American wilderness, and a hugely popular public attraction in Yellowstone, the grizzly bear would be the biggest animal to come off the endangered species list since the California gray whale was delisted in 1994.
Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S. Department of Interior said Tuesday.
