In an apparent response to mounting demands from students and opposition groups, Indonesian legislators on Friday agreed to launch an investigation into former president Soeharto's wealth.
Indonesian Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib pledged to hunt state assets which were allegedly stashed overseas during the 32-year rule of former president Soeharto, the Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
The office of Indonesia's attorney general has formed a team to investigate the wealth of present and former Indonesian government officials, a spokesman of the office said here Tuesday.
Local people and students in Indonesia's capital Jakarta held an anti-Soeharto mass demonstration, starting at 14:00 local time on Thursday.
