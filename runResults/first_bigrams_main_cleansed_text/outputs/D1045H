China focus: China pledges to minimize impact of river pollution on Russia
China and Russia have both pledged to cooperate closely to handle the pollution of the Songhua River  in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, said Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Thursday.
Two reservoirs on the Songhua River on Thursday reinforced water discharge to dilute a massive slick  of chemical pollutants floating through this capital of northeast  China's Heilongjiang.
China's State Environmental  Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the  Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution  incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the  upper reaches.
