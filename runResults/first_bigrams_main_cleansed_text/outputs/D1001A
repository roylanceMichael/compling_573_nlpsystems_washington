Students returned to classes Thursday at   Chatfield High School, but the bloodbath at rival Columbine High  haunted the halls.
Republican presidential candidate Pat   Buchanan says stricter gun laws could not have prevented the deadly  school shootings in Littleton, Colo.
The day that Columbine High School   students are to return to class has been delayed because so many  have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20  massacre, an administrator said Tuesday.
The sheriff's initial estimate of as   many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark  apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building  counted some victims more than once.
