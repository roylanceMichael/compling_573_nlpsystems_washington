Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in  an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to  escalate its killing of whales.
Australia strongly opposes Japanese  plans to expand its whaling catch in Antarctic waters but will not  try to board Japanese whaling ships there because it could be  accused of piracy, Attorney General Philip Ruddock said Saturday.
Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure  seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday  after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in  the name of scientific research.
