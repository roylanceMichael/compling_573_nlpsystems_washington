Natalee Holloway's family, not Aruban police, first identified and located a Dutch youth now held as a suspect in the disappearance of the Alabama teen, according to a friend who helped with the search.
Police questioned the father of a Dutch teenager detained in connection with the case of a missing American teenager, hoping he may have seen something to help resolve the mystery, officials said Sunday.
Almost a week after arresting the son of a prominent Dutch judge in the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, officials in Aruba searched his home Wednesday.
Three young men who acknowledged partying with an 18-year-old honors student from Alabama before she went missing last week told police that a man dressed in a security uniform approached her as they dropped her off at her hotel, a source close to the investigation said Thursday.
