In Cairo, Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a newspaper stand, was among a minority who said he believed the United States attacks were justified.
Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about six missiles during the attack.
U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
