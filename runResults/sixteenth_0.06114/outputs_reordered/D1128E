Lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor, on trial at a UN-backed court in The Hague for alleged war crimes, demanded Friday more time to construct his defence.
In the run-up to the trial Taylor's lawyers had complained that there were insufficient resources for the defence with just two attorneys versus some nine prosecution trial lawyers.
Taylor's family also accused the Special War Crimes Court in The Hague, where the ex-leader is imprisoned, of violating Taylor's right to privacy and right to legal professional privilege by installing a video surveillance camera to record conferences with his attorneys.
