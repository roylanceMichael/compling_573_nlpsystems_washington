Around the country, worried pet owners inundated veterinarian's offices and pet stores with calls Monday, concerned that the food might have sickened their pets.
Menu Foods is recalling only certain gravy-style pet food in cans and pouches it made from Dec. 3 to March 6.
An unknown number of cats and dogs suffered kidney failure, and about 10 died after eating the affected pet food, Menu Foods said in announcing the North American recall.
The company also makes pet food under contract for branded pet- food companies that sell prestige names like Science Diet and Iams.
