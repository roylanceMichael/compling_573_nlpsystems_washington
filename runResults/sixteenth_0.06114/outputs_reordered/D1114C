Most heart defects either obstruct blood flow in the heart or vessels near it, or cause blood to flow through the heart in an abnormal way.
The heart peptide test might help decide, for example, whether a patient needs coronary artery bypass surgery, considered a highly effective, but risky approach to cardiovascular disease.
Congenital heart defects are structural problems arising from abnormal formation of the heart or major blood vessels near the heart that occurs before birth.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in three deaths.
