Hong Kong's Department of Health (DH) on Thursday reported four more suspected cases of Influenza A H5N1, bringing the number to 10 in addition to nine confirmed cases.
However, "the transmission of the virus both from bird to human and human to human is possible," Chan said.
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong.
Macao experts today warned residents to be careful but not panic over the bird flu that has killed children in neighboring Hong Kong.
A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
