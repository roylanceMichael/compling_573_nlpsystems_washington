Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
"This is the work of the government," Yushchenko said upon his return to Kiev late Sunday from an Austrian clinic where doctors confirmed for the first time that he had somehow swallowed massive amounts of the toxin that can cause cancer and death.
Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin.
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic confirmed for the first time that Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.
