The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
Evidence of diabetes' link to use of herbicides or dioxin is listed by the study as still ``inadequate or insufficient'' to draw an association with Agent Orange or other chemicals used in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971.
The review keeps four diseases on the list of those for which evidence establishes links with exposure to herbicides widely used as defoliants in Vietnam: soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and cholaracne.
