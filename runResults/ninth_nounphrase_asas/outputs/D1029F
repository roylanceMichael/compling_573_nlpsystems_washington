The government and tribal forces fought a 16-hour gunbattle in Dera Bugti on Thursday that officials say left at least eight troops and 22 tribesmen dead.
On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties from the province's natural resources.
