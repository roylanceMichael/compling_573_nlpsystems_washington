Demonstrators and opposition leaders have been demanding that an investigation be conducted into whether Soeharto and his family accumulated wealth illegally while he was in power.
Soeharto, who abruptly resigned from the presidency on May 21 under strong pressure from the House of Representatives, his cabinet ministers and demonstrating students, has been accused of amassing tens of billions of dollars from corruption, collusion and numerous shady business deals.
The United Development Party faction earlier asked for a separate decree to contain investigation into Soeharto, officials, former officials and their families.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
