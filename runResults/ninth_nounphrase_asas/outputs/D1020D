Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs.
Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and cold cuts.
Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing four.
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
