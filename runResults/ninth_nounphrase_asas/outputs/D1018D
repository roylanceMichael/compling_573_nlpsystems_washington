Three young men who acknowledged partying with an 18-year-old honors student from Alabama before she went missing last week told police that a man dressed in a security uniform approached her as they dropped her off at her hotel, a source close to the investigation said Thursday.
Police on Thursday searched for clues into the disappearance of an Alabama teen a day after conducting a late-night helicopter flyover of the Dutch Caribbean island and seizing items from the home of a Dutch justice official whose son was with her the day she went missing.
Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, the son of a prominent judicial official, and brothers Satish Kalpoe, 18, and Deepak Kalpoe, 21 -- are still being held and are now the focus of an intensifying investigation into the disappearance of the girl.
