Full90 does not claim that its headgear prevent concussions.
In the 15 months since FIFA, soccer's world governing body, began permitting its use, headgear has been used by thousands of American players from youth leagues to high school to colleges to the pros.
This has triggered alarmed skepticism within the U.S. Soccer Federation, which contends that marketing to the fears of parents has trumped science regarding the effectiveness of headgear in preventing concussions.
The De Anza Force soccer club of Cupertino, Calif., will require headgear for players under 17, beginning in March, said Tom Pridham, a club official.
"I remember when baseball players didn't wear batting helmets," said Steve Ryan, commissioner of the Major Indoor Soccer League, which approves of headgear.
