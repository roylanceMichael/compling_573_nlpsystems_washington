A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
A tremor shook Mount St. Helens for 25 minutes early Sunday, prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption two days after the volcano came back to life.
"The eruption was predominantly steam but containing a little bit of ash," he said adding that there were no lava or mud flows from the crater and that the alert level in the region had not been raised.
Mount St. Helens, the volcano that blew its top with cataclysmic force in 1980, erupted for the first time in 18 years Friday, belching a huge column of white steam and ash after days of rumblings.
