Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, said he also supported taking bears off the list.
As the Bush administration prepares to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list, a schism has emerged in the environmental movement over whether the bears remain at risk.
State and federal agencies will monitor the bears and their habitat and responsibility for managing bears will be turned over to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming.
If adopted, the proposal would apply only to bears outside Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.
The grizzlies would continue to be monitored by federal scientists, with 10 percent of the bears always wearing radio collars.
