"We have stopped production" at Snorre A, Kristofer Hetland, a spokesman for Statoil, told AFP.
Until repairs are completed production has been halted on the Snorre A platform, causing losses of 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) and on neighboring platform Vigdis, entailing losses of 75,000 bpd.
Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform itself.
