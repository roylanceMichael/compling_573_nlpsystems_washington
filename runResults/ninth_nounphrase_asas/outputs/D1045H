The front of the polluted water of Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang Province, on early Thursday morning, local environment authority said.
The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, where the river originates.
China and Russia have both pledged to cooperate closely to handle the pollution of the Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Thursday.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
