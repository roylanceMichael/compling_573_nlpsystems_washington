Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
Meanwhile Cui is also confident about the economic returns of the project, since the area boasts rich land resources and favorable soil and climate conditions for the growing of tropical rain trees.
Chinese government has always attached great importance to the protection of this area.
The area, bordering on Myanmar and Laos, earned its reputation as "a kingdom of plants and animals" for its more than 20,000 species of plants, 429 species of birds, and 67 species of animals.
