More than half of the 710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to studies by a leading local nutritionist.
The study attributed the reason to the increasing incidence of obesity among UAE nationals, which is strongly linked to diabetes.
People in the 7-12 and 60-70 age groups run a greater risk of becoming overweight, and incidence of obesity in males is higher than in females, the survey showed.
More than 40 percent of Kuwaiti women are obese and suffer from other chronic ailments such as vein-hardening, diabetes and hypertension, local press reported today, citing a Kuwaiti psychologist.
