- On November 7, 2003, England posed for a photograph pointing at the word "rapeist" that had been written and incorrectly spelled on the exposed buttocks of a detainee.
England had faced up to 16 1/2 years in prison if convicted on all full nine counts, which included conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment and indecent acts.
"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the background of being a corrections officer," said England, who pled guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in October and November 2003.
England and the other soldiers accused have insisted that they were following orders from military intelligence officers at the prison to "soften up" the prisoners for interrogation.
