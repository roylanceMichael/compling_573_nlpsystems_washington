As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the algae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically speaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says.
Some scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that anybody has spent five years trying to save it.
Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year.
Industry advocates said that they also favor viewing the fisheries as one interconnected system but that current data aren't sufficient to limit fishing for menhaden in the bay.
