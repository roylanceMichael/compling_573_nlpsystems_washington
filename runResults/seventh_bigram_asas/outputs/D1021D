TAMPA - Investigators say it began with a note, passed in a math class at Wharton High School.
"The victim denied it.
The announcement sent a ripple through the courtroom as reporters hurriedly scribbled in note pads and scrambled for cell phones.
"To try to use (media interest) to make it more difficult for the victims' family to go through this process made sense from a tactical standpoint," said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore, noting that Lafave attended many hearings in the case, ensuring cameras would capture her every move.
LaFave was arrested in June and suspended from her job until the trial is over.
