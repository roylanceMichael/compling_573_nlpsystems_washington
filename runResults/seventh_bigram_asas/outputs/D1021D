Last month, a Hillsborough judge said she will forever lose her teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman said LaFave also will forever lose her teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
