The Food Standards Agency sparked an international food safety alert on Feb. 18 when it announced that a sauce contaminated with the dye had been used in hundreds of British foods and exported to several European and Caribbean countries and to North America.
The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
Bell said the problem was uncovered when supplies reached an Italian company which tested for Sudan 1.
"I regret that more than 18 months after the (EU decision) establishing the control regime, certain industrial operators have not faced up to their responsibilities and cleaned up their stocks of raw material," said EU health and consumer protection commissioner Markos Kyprianou.
