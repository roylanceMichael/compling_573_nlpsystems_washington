On Monday, Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
Hariri was prime minister for 10 of the 14 years since Lebanon's 15-year war ended in 1990.
Barnier said France would continue to work toward achieving its demand for an international investigation.
The bombing has also led to renewed international pressure led by the US and France for Syria to withdraw its 14,000 troops from neighboring Lebanon.
Hariri, who came to office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years, resigned last October.
