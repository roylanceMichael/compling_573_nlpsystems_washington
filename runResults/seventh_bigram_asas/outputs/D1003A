The giant panda is one of the world's most rare and endangered species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous regions of Sichuan in southwest China, and northwestern Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
Twenty-two giant pandas living in parts of Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in the northwestern province of Gansu will be moved to other locations with better food, the China Daily said, quoting Zhang Kerong, director of the reserve.
