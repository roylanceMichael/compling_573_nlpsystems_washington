Zhang said that 22 giant pandas living in the Bikou and Rangshuihe areas, where much of the bamboo is blooming, are currently under the threat of starvation.
The central and provincial governments have invested 160 million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection programs since 1992.
Wolong is a famous giant panda habitat where the world-known China Conservation and Research Center of the Giant Panda is located.
Workers in the preserve will move old and weak giant pandas and lure fit pandas to a new habitats, Zhang said.
Winter is often a hard time for old or weak wildlife.
But in Sichuan and in Shaanxi province, which also has panda reserves, arrow bamboo has also been found blooming.
