The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
In the mid 1990s the British government announced a probable link between BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human form of mad cow disease, which can cause personality change, loss of body function, and eventually death.
A person who donated blood several times over the past 10 years has been diagnosed as the eighth case of the human form of mad cow disease in France since the invariably fatal illness was declared a public health risk in 1996, officials said.
