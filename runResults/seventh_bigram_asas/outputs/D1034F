Atrazine, a herbicide widely used today on corn, might also contribute to the sexuality problems and decline of the frogs, the report says.
The study, a three-year collaborative effort between 500 zoologists, biologists, and wildlife specialists around the world, was organized by three wildlife organizations: NatureServe, Conservation International, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs, salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most endangered class of animals on Earth, with their rapid decline outpacing that of mammals and birds.
``These guys have been around a long time, since before the dinosaurs, and they are declining all over the place,'' said Val Beasley, a co-author of the study and a professor of ecotoxicology at the university's College of Veterinary Medicine
