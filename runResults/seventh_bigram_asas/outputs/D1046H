The Chinese team arrived in Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, at 05:10 a.m. local time by a chartered plane.
The sources said as part of the planned 1,000 metric tons of HEB, the government is contemplating of sending several hundred tons of HEB to Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Maldives in the coming weeks.
The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane headed for Medan, the main city on Indonesia's Sumatra island, one of the areas hardest hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami, the ministry said in a statement.
The official of the ministry said that at least 476,619 people were refugees, and the figure could increase as there were still many others uncounted by the officials.
