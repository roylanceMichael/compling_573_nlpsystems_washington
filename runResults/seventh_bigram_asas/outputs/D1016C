Meanwhile, according to a survey result by the Indonesian Business Data Center which was published here Monday, the assets of Soeharto's family have reached 200 trillion rupiah (about 20 billion U.S. dollars).
Ismudjoko said that while the investigation was very urgent, it would take some time to complete as the work would involve the checking of many documents related to a large number of business deals.
"With this letter of authorization, I can go anywhere in the world to search accounts that may be held by Soeharto," Ghalib was quoted by the newspaper The Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
He said many senior officials such as ministers, governors, regents and mayors also had amassed wealth through corruption, collusion and nepotism during Soeharto's 32 years in power.
