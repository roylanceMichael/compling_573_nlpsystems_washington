Built at the peak of the oyster rush, in the late 1890s and early years of the 20th century, skipjacks are light, inexpensive boats that can navigate the shallow waters of the bay.
Among the bay's problems, one of the worst has been the decline of the native oyster Crassostrea virginica,@ once so populous that its reefs poked out of the water.
The leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed agreed Monday to lobby Capitol Hill for about $12 billion for cleaning up the bay.
Many of the remaining skipjacks have become museum pieces, like the Martha Lewis in Baltimore, preserved by the Chesapeake Heritage Conservancy, and the E.C. Collier, now in the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels.
