Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three million barrels.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
The suspension of operations means a loss of 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) out of a total of some three million bpd normally produced by Norway, the world's third-largest exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
