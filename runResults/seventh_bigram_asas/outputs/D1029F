"There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence there," Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Yaqub told AFP.
Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told reporters in the capital, Islamabad, that tribal fighters were digging in around Dera Bugti and destroying roads.
Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao said tribesmen used light and heavy weapons and rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on a nearby paramilitary base from 12 different directions.
Eight soldiers were killed and 23 injured in fierce desert gunbattles with tribal rebels in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, officials said Friday.
