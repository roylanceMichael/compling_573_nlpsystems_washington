According to a recent city survey, more than 40 percent of the teenagers suffer from anemia caused by malnutrition and about 20 percent of middle school students are overweight, "China Daily" reports today.
The growth will be registered in both developed and, especially, developing countries, due to population aging, unhealthy diets, obesity and a secondary lifestyle.
The survey was conducted jointly by the Xiangshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition and Food Research Section of the Shanghai Medical Science University.
Medical experts suggested that citizens, especially people suffering from obesity, should follow advice to change their life styles and diets.
Many spoiled teenagers from one-child families eat only a particular kind of food, such as meat or sweets, which might easily lead them to develop obesity, diabetes or heart disease.
