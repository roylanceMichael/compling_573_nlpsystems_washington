Kaczynski, the 55-year-old former university math instructor is suspected of being the UNABOMber, the mailbomb terrorist who killed three people and injured 23 others in 17 years before his arrest last year.
Explosive devices placed or mailed by the notorious UNABOMber killed three people and injured 23 during a 17-year reign of terror that began in 1978.
Lawyers for UNABOMber suspect Theodore Kaczynski are asking for special measures to find northern California jurors who aren't biased against him by news coverage.
Legal experts say Kaczynski's best hope is escaping the death penalty in the second phase of the trial, if he's convicted, on grounds that he has had lifelong mental problems.
