Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness, but said Saturday that tests conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin.
"It was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing reports," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said when he was asked at a news briefing about the US reaction to the poisoning of Ukrainian presidential candidate Yushchenko.
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of substances.
"There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by poisoning of dioxin," said Michael Zimpfer, director of the Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving treatment.
