"Although there are precedents for both pilots losing consciousness at the controls of the aircraft in the past, for it to happen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737, with all the backup systems they have there, does seem to be really quite extraordinary," said Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry.
The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond to radio calls.
