The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Floyd was expected to intensify today, becoming a Category 3 hurricane, and it could become a Category 4 with sustained winds of at least 131 mph by Tuesday afternoon, when it's expected to reach the northern Bahamas.
``But it's not going to threaten any land anywhere over the weekend,'' said Stacy Stewart, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center
"The center of Floyd is still in the formative stage, but it has intensified," said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami.
Even though the storm was expected to turn before making a landfall in that area, its hurricane-force wind could still rake the coast by the middle of the week.
