A petrochemical plant blast that occurred two weeks ago spilled large amount of benzene liquids into the Songhua River, resulting in heavy pollution in the section of Harbin, capital of the Heilongjiang province.
China and Russia have both pledged to cooperate closely to handle the pollution of the Songhua River in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao here Thursday.
He said the polluted water in the Songhua River, which reached Heilongjiang provincial capital Harbin on Thursday morning, is expected to flow into the Heilongjiang River (called the Amur River in Russia) on the Sino-Russian border in around 14 days judging from the current flow speed.
