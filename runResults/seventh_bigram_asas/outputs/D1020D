So far, no cases of illness have been linked to the recalled products, the USDA said.
After several days of debate among medical experts, CDC officials clearly determined there was a public health threat on Dec. 22, the day of the recall, said Dr. Paul Mead of the CDC.
The culprit, investigators say, is a strain of air and soil-borne bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes, which is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come into contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat.
In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the announcement of the recall to the company.
The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States.
