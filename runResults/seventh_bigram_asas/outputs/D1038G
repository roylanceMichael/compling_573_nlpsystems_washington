Seismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking Mount St. Helens for the past week and a half.
The eruption occurred at 12:03 p.m., when there was a small explosion, followed by the steam and ash cloud that rose from the southern edge of a 1,000-foot (305-meter)-tall lava dome in the volcano's crater.
