where jurors are considering whether actor Robert Blake killed his wife -- for the Laugh Factory, both sides have exploited humor as a tool for making their cases.
"The defendant overestimated his acting abilities," Shellie Samuels said Wednesday, citing witness testimony that Blake didn't appear to be sincere when he cried the night his wife was shot to death.
The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
The judge said closing arguments will begin Wednesday and the case will be sent to the jury Friday.
