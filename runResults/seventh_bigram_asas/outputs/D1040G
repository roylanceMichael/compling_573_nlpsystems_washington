Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
"He shot people on TV, he shot people in the movies, but he never really shot in real life," she said.
"It's all about Rosie," he said, referring to the baby he had with slain wife Bonny Lee Bakley.
Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of stuntmen Gary McLarty and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton, who each testified Blake asked them to ``pop'' or ``snuff'' his wife, laying out multiple scenarios to kill her including one involving the restaurant near where she was killed May 4, 2001.
