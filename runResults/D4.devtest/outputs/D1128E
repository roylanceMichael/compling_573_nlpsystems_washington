Former Liberian President Charles Taylor will not be ready for the start of his trial in June on charges of overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in West Africa, his lawyer told a judge Friday.
Lawyers for former Liberian president Charles Taylor, on trial at a UN-backed court in The Hague for alleged war crimes, demanded Friday more time to construct his defence.
In the run-up to the trial Taylor's lawyers had complained that there were insufficient resources for the defence with just two attorneys versus some nine prosecution trial lawyers.
