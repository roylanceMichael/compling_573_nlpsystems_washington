Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
