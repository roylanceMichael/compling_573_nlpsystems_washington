Cyclone Sidr, described as the worst storm in years to hit low-lying and disaster-prone Bangladesh, crashed into the southwestern coast Thursday night before sweeping north over the capital Dhaka.
The powerful cyclone 'Sidr' with all its fury and ferocity lashed south and southwestern regions of Bangladesh claiming huge lives.
The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has allocated 98 tons of ready food from its emergency hub to feed 400,000 victims of cyclone 'Sidr' in the southern Bangladesh.
Hundreds of people died and tens of thousands were left homeless after a powerful cyclone smashed impoverished Bangladesh with huge waves, severe winds and torrential rains in Bangladesh, officials said Friday.
Cyclone Sidr, visible in satellite images as a huge swirling white mass over the Bay of Bengal, was also expected to unleash tidal surges of up to six metres (20 feet) in some areas.
