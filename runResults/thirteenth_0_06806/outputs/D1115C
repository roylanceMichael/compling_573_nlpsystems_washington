Environmental and other damage from Friday's spill would likely be less compared with 1995, said Jang Ki-pyo, a Maritime and Fisheries Ministry official, as the leaked oil would be quickly frozen during cold winter temperatures and because the accident took place about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from shore.
In the previous largest offshore oil spill in South Korea, an oil tanker spilled 30,740 barrels of crude and fuel off the south coast in 1995, costing 96 billion won, or $101 million, in cleanup operations and damages to fishermen.
The Coast Guard dispatched 34 coast guard, navy and other government vessels as well as four helicopters to stop the spread of the spill and collect the oil, Jung said.
A Hong Kong-registered oil tanker collided with another vessel in seas off South Korea's west coast Friday and leaked about 15,000 tons of crude oil, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.
