Veterans groups from the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Japan and Vietnam turned out Thursday to dedicate the Vietnam Friendship Village, which is testimony that old enemies can work together.
Hoang Dinh Cau, chairman of the National Committee for Investigation of Defects from Toxic Chemicals Used During the Vietnam War, said recent studies show dioxin levels are dropping, along with high rates of birth defects, in the affected areas.
The symbolism was lost on the children, all born with birth defects that often are the result of contact by parents with dioxin, a toxic component of the war-era defoliant Agent Orange.
American herbicides, of which the most prominent was Agent Orange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps, and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands.
