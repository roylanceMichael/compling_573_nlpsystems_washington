Celebrex is the 10th most popular drug in the United States, with annual sales of $2.7 billion, up 5 percent in a year, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks drug industry trends.
Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, who chairs the House Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, giving him two weeks to answer questions about how FDA tracks problems with drug safety, how it dealt with issues surrounding Vioxx, and whether the agency will study potential risks in similar drugs.
In a certain sense, Merck &amp; Co.'s decision to cease selling Vioxx, its best-selling painkiller, demonstrates how the peculiarly American combination of government regulation and private-sector competition can, serendipitously, sometimes work well.
Despite clear beneficiaries like Emily Martin, though, many medical experts say most patients would do just as well with various cheaper, over-the-counter remedies for indigestion and heartburn, including AstraZeneca's own Prilosec -- a chemically similar predecessor that no longer requires a prescription and sells for $40 a month or less.
