One Israeli woman was killed and at least eight others wounded on Monday in a suicide bombing which ripped through a commercial center in the southern Israeli town of Dimona, the first attack of the kind since January 2007.
According to the spokesman, the first suicide attack on Israeli soil in more than a year was carried out in cooperation with the military wings of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP).
The death toll rose to three that killed and five moderately injured Monday morning in a attack carried out by a suicide bomber at a commercial center in the southern Israeli city of Dimona, local daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported on its website.
Two Palestinian suicide bombers attempted to carry out a twin bombing attack in a busy commercial center of southern Israeli town of Dimona.
In a statement on Monday, the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority condemned the Dimona attack.
