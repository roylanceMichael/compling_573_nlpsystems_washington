John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's district attorney.
Haddon, the Ramsey attorney, said the family's communication with the district attorney actually began over a year ago and included handing over records regarding medical, phone, bank and business matters.
According to these newspaper accounts, Mrs. Ramsey can be heard screaming, and JonBenet's brother, Burke, then 10, can be heard asking what she had found.
With the threat looming of a grand jury inquest into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the parents of the murdered beauty princess Thursday completed three days of questioning by prosecutors here, breaking their 16 months of official silence.
In response to these calls, Hunter cut short a vacation in Alaska, returned to Colorado, met with Gov. Roy Romer and announced that he would take the case to a grand jury soon, probably next month.
