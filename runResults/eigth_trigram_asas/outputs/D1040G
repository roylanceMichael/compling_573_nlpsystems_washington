Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user, said Blake solicited him to kill his wife.
Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of stuntmen Gary McLarty and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton, who each testified Blake asked them to ``pop'' or ``snuff'' his wife, laying out multiple scenarios to kill her including one involving the restaurant near where she was killed May 4, 2001.
Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, a former methamphetamine user who testified that Blake solicited him to kill Bakley, had maintained until six months after the crime that he knew of no such murder plot.
"`I'm going to kill her right by a restaurant that I've been going to for 30 years,'" defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach said Thursday during closing arguments, mocking the allegations against his client.
