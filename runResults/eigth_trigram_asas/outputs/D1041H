The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the world's coral reefs next month.
Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
Only about 30 percent of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down from 41 percent two years ago, according to a study released Monday that lists global warming as the top threat.
