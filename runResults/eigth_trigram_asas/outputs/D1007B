Of the nine confirmed cases, a three-year-old boy, a 13-year-old girl and a 54-year-old man have died.
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
Of the other nine suspected cases, one has been discharged from hospital, six are under treatment with their condition satisfactory or stable and two are in critical condition, according to the DH update.
