Judge Bob Wit, who was sent in from the neighboring Dutch island of Curacao, extended the detention of Joran van der Sloot, 17, and brothers, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, for eight days, said Mariaine Croes, who is not related to the fourth detainee.
Lawyers for van der Sloot and brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, of Suriname, also filed legal motions Wednesday asking to see the evidence against their clients.
Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18 _ were interrogated by police the next day and released.
Those are the same suspicions prosecutors have used to hold three suspects who have been in custody for eleven days: Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, and brother Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18.
