A wave of copycat threats of violence prompted by the Tuesday massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., prompted school and law-enforcement officials across the country to respond quickly to any new sign of trouble, even if the threats were pranks brought on by a dose of youthful spring fever.
To accommodate the 1,965 Columbine students, the school day is being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p.m.
The sheriff's initial estimate of as many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims more than once.
