JAKARTA (JP): The government has launched an investigation into corruption under former president Soeharto but has no plans to specifically target the former Indonesian leader, Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro told a packed news conference here yesterday.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
