Police have largely ruled out sectarian rivalry and say Saturday's attack on the holy site may be linked to bloody clashes two days earlier between government forces and nationalist clans in the unruly province of Baluchistan.
On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
