Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird flu" that has killed two people.
In a notice issued through the Macao Daily News Thursday, the health department said that residents should avoid contacting birds in case they might be infected with the deadly virus of bird flu known as H5N1.
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a 13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
