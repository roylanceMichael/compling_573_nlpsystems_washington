The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996, six other diseases were listed as those with ``limited or suggestive evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the contaminant dioxin.
Evidence of diabetes' link to use of herbicides or dioxin is listed by the study as still ``inadequate or insufficient'' to draw an association with Agent Orange or other chemicals used in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971.
