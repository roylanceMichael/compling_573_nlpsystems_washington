Studies have documented an array of threats, varying from place to place, including infectious disease, destruction of freshwater and rainforest habitats, introduction of non-native predators such as trout, pesticides, parasites, global climate change and the thinning ozone layer.
The study, a three-year collaborative effort between 500 zoologists, biologists, and wildlife specialists around the world, was organized by three wildlife organizations: NatureServe, Conservation International, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.
Isolated reports of silent forests and empty streams began to circulate about three decades ago, but the latest assessment is the first to provide a complete snapshot of a global decline in the diversity of frogs, salamanders, newts, and worm-like caecilians, and to show that they are at greater risk than both birds and mammals.
