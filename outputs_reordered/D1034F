Frogs are considered a key sentinel for effects of environmental degradation because they undergo a vulnerable time of metamorphosis and spend most of their time in water, where pollutants accumulate.
Scientists began noticing the disappearance of amphibians in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but before this study they'd never conducted a worldwide assessment of the frogs, toads, salamanders and legless caecilians, also called rubber eels.
"If people encounter them, they can kill them and send us the actual animal or they can take photos," Jensen said.
