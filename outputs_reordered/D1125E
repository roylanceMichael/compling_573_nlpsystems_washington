More polar bears are being seen near human settlements in Canada, they say, therefore polar bear populations must be increasing.
On Dec. 27, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne announced a proposal to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act because of the loss of its sea ice habitat from global warming.
The federal agency responsible for protecting Arctic polar bears has barred two Alaska scientists from speaking about polar bears, climate change or sea ice at international meetings in the next few weeks, a move that environmentalists say is censorship.
Kieran Suckling, policy director of the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that submitted the petition to list the polar bear, said muzzling of scientists at international meetings isn't appropriate.
The listing is opposed by Alaska Republican Governor Sarah Palin, who has said listing polar bears has the potential to damage the Alaska economy without any benefit to polar bear numbers or their habitat.
