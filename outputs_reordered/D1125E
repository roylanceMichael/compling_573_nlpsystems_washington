The federal agency responsible for protecting Arctic polar bears has barred two Alaska scientists from speaking about polar bears, climate change or sea ice at international meetings in the next few weeks, a move that environmentalists say is censorship.
The listing is opposed by Alaska Republican Governor Sarah Palin, who has said listing polar bears has the potential to damage the Alaska economy without any benefit to polar bear numbers or their habitat.
