At Hennepin County Medical Center, patients had arrived in a steady stream after the collapse, some unconscious or moaning, some barely breathing, others with serious head and back injuries, Dr. William Heegaard said.
The eight-lane Interstate 35W bridge, a major Minneapolis artery, was being repaired and two lanes in each direction were closed when the bridge buckled Wednesday evening, breaking into huge sections and collapsing into the river, pitching dozens of cars 60 feet (18 meters) into the water and killing at least seven.
