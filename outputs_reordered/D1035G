The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
According to U.S. records, the United States sprayed about 12 million gallons (45 million liters) of Agent Orange over parts of southern and central Vietnam in 1961-71.
A 1989 court ruling in the case voided all VA benefit decisions it had made based on the agency's assertion that only the skin disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange.
