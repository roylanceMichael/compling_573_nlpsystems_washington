Veterans groups from the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Japan and Vietnam turned out Thursday to dedicate the Vietnam Friendship Village, which is testimony that old enemies can work together.
The symbolism was lost on the children, all born with birth defects that often are the result of contact by parents with dioxin, a toxic component of the war-era defoliant Agent Orange.
The Veterans Association in Washington now offers compensation for 10 diseases, as well as for the birth defect spina bifida, that have been determined to be linked, or possibly linked, to the spraying in Vietnam.
American herbicides, of which the most prominent was Agent Orange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps, and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands.
