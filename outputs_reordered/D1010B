Department of Health officials said Friday that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S. beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow disease late last year.
According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on 85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered there in December 2003.
Canada, whose exports of beef products are effected by a single case of mad cow disease since may 2003, has exceeded its mad cow testing target for 2004, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported Sunday.
The health department suspended the import of beef and related products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow disease.
Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the United States has to be evaluated.
