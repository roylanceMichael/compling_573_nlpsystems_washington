According to the US navy, the tanker -- which is as big as three soccer fields -- is the largest ship ever seized by pirates and the hijacking was the farthest out to sea Somali bandits have attacked a vessel.
The hijacking follows a string of increasingly brazen attacks by Somali pirates in recent months, but this appeared to be first time they have seized an oil tanker.
Saturday's hijacking of the MV Sirius Star tanker occurred in the Indian Ocean far south of the zone patrolled by international warships in the busy Gulf of Aden shipping channel, which leads to and from the Suez Canal.
Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
