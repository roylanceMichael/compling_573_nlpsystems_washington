At least 65 of the sea turtleshave been found dead along a five-kilometer (three-mile) stretch of beach near Cox's Bazar, one of the main cities on Bangladesh's coast.
Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province, off the coast of eastern Sabah state.
Jeff George, curator at Sea Turtle Inc., a nonprofit turtle rescue group on South Padre Island, said 42 of the endangered juvenile green turtles were released Tuesday and 46 on Wednesday.
