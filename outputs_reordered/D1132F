He said Malaysian marine police seized the turtles from the Hainan fishermen's trawler late last month after they were caught in the waters off Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island.
Only 20 of the 240 Hawksbill and Green turtles were found alive after marine police arrested the poachers, from southern Hainan province, off the coast of eastern Sabah state.
Jeff George, curator at Sea Turtle Inc., a nonprofit turtle rescue group on South Padre Island, said 42 of the endangered juvenile green turtles were released Tuesday and 46 on Wednesday.
