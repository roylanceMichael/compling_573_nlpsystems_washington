Xinjiang is blamed for nearly 30 percent of China's total acreage of soil erosion, the regional water resources administration said.
The area affected by soil erosion expanded by about 15,000 sq km in China every year due to man-made factors, causing an increase of 300 million tons of soil loss annually, said E.
China will encourage its farmers to use more environmentally-friendly fertilizers and pesticides to reduce pollution of the soil, rivers and lakes, according to the document, which is the year's first major policy paper jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.
China's hillside farm areas lose 1.5 billion tons of soil annually, about a third of the nation's total soil loss each year, said Vice Water Resources Minister E Jingping on Friday.
China has reversed soil erosion over an area of 960,000 square kilometers, or 10 percent of its total land area, sources with the Ministry of Water Resources said on Thursday.
