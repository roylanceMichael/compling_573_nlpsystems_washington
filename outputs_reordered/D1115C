The tanker, the Hebei Spirit, and the other vessel, owned by South Korea's Samsung Corp., were in no danger of sinking, the Coast Guard said.
Jung Se-hi, a spokesman at Coast Guard headquarters in Incheon, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Seoul, said 34 coast guard, navy and other government vessels as well as four helicopters were involved in the operation, with efforts focused on cleanup after the leak had been stopped.
