Studies have presented contradictory results, and the matter remains disputed as the soccer federation undertakes a long-term examination of head injuries.
But the company does say the headgear can reduce, by up to 50 percent, the peak impact forces that occur during typical collisions when a player's head strikes another head, the ground, an elbow or a goal post.
Better training is needed -- players should use their shoulders or chests and keep their heads up during tackles -- and penalties for helmet contacts must be enforced.
