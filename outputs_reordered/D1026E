The Ugandan government has granted another month as the final deadline for motorists, especially owners of public service vehicles to have their vehicles fitted with safety belts, reported the state-owned newspaper The New Vision on Friday.
The Ugandan police has warned to enforce strict traffic regulations beginning from Tuesday, saying that passengers who will travel in vehicles without wearing safety belts will be arrested.
Police ticketed more than 2,500 people in the Argentine capital for failing to wear seatbelts in the opening days of a campaign that had motorists fuming as they reluctantly buckled up.
