The seven Colorado basin states- Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, California- would battle each other for diminished Colorado River flows.
The melting snow on the western slopes of the Rockies feeds into the Colorado River to flow west and south, across parts of Colorado, Utah and Arizona, and, since the construction of the dam, into Lake Mead, some 30 miles east of Las Vegas.
Against that backdrop, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and California began negotiations in 2005 to write a blueprint for water shortages.
