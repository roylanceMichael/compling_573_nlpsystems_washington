Alvarez, 29, faces 11 counts of murder, one count each of train wrecking and arson, as well as special-circumstance allegations of multiple murder and train wrecking.
Less moving were the testimony of Alvarez's older cousin Beto Alvarez, who now is helping raise Juan's son and his adopted daughter, and his estranged wife, Carmen, the woman prosecutors say Alvarez was attempting to impress and win back when he caused the disaster in which a Metrolink train derailed and smashed into another commuter train.
