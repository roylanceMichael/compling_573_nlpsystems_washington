During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
It was an alarming escalation of a low-level rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province, where tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region.
On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
