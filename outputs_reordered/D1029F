During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising which was brutally put down by the government.
A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the tribesmen in Baluchistan _ the biggest and poorest of Pakistan's four provinces _ which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s.
On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
Thursday's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province.
The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in Baluchistan.
