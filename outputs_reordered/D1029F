Four people were injured and a powerline and a government office damaged in three separate bomb blasts in southwestern Pakistan's restive Baluchistan province, officials said Sunday.
Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said.
