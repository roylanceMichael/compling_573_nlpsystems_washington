On Sunday, authorities filed a case against Bugti, one of his grand sons and 150 of his supporters for involvement in the attack on the troops on Thursday near Dera Bugti, said Shoaib Nausherwani, Baluchistan's home minister.
Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier Corps soldiers, officials said.
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti tribesmen, left Dera Bugti, a day after 3,000 government employees and their families, fearing more fighting in the town, located some 300 kilometers (185 miles) southeast of Quetta, Baluchistan's provincial capital.
Thursday's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province.
