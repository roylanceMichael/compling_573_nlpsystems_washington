Global warming will negatively impact China's ecological, social and economic systems, especially farming, animal husbandry and water supply, and some damage will be irreversible, said the report.
China, like the rest of the world, will increasingly face problems of extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, drought and more intense typhoons because of the effects of global warming, he said.
Severe drought has had a debilitating effect on the Yangtze River, China's longest waterway, over the last two weeks, leaving at least 1 million people in Chongqing Municipality with water shortages, local water authorities said on Monday.
