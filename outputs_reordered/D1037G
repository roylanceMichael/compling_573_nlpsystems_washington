There are Tilghman Island Day, the J. Millard Tawes Oyster and Bull Roast in Crisfield, the St. Michaels Oysterfest, the Urbanna Oyster Festival, and the biggest pearl of them all for oyster lovers _the St. Mary's County Oyster Festival this weekend, home to the National Oyster Shucking Championship and National Oyster Cook-Off Contest.
Monday's annual meeting, at a conference center on the grounds of Mount Vernon, Va., provided a chance for officials from Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assess the bay's health.
In places like Tilghman, watermen still motor up to the dock at Harrison's packing company to deliver their day's haul, just as they have for generations, and inside, shuckers still wait to crack them open in record time, as they, too, have done for generations.
