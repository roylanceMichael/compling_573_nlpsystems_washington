Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf, which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
The administration's efforts so far to protect coral reefs include improving monitoring and satellite surveillance, agreeing to Geneva-based treaty restrictions on international trade in coral reefs and passing out $10 million (euro7.4 million) in grants, Lautenbacher said.
In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of many coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.
