"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into the reefs," Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef survey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the tsunami struck, said in an e-mail.
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
Before the hurricanes struck, the scientists, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Florida, began examining reefs stretching about 130 miles from Fort Pierce to north of Miami.
The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D.
"Reefs provide seafood for one billion people in Asia alone, many of them from poor communities.
The conservation union -- which produces a "red list" of the world's most endangered species -- also warned the destruction of reefs would have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
