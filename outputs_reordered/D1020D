At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states.
Some Agriculture Department officials said they would like more legal authority to focus on the danger to public health when they recommend recalls, so they can warn the public faster.
