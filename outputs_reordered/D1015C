China's largest tropical rain forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province, will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from 247,000 ha
The province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only tropical rain forest in the country located there.
Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
Xishuangbanna, one of China's largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare plants to a special 90-ha
Gibbons are regarded as an animal indicator in the tropical rain forest.
