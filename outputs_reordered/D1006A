Merck &amp; Co. removed Vioxx from use Thursday after new study results showed increased risk of heart attacks and stroke in people who used it for longer than 18 mon

When Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx, FDA officials said heart problems were unique to that drug and that the mechanism underlying them wasn't known.
In a separate report also released by the medical journal, Dr. Eric Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when hints of them first appeared years ago, and for allowing the company to blitz consumers with TV ads touting the drug.
The controversy grew Friday when Grassley asked Merck, among other things, about an e-mail provided by Graham in which a Merck official complained that the FDA had not lived up to a prior agreement to alert the company before releasing any negative information about its products.
