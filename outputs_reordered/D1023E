VIENNA- At least eight people have been confirmed killed and 30 others injured as two avalanches roared through a ski resort in Austria's western state of Triol on Tuesday evening, the Austrian news media reported.
Here in Landeck, more than 20 miles east of Galtuer, Austrian authorities turned a military barracks compound into an avalanche-emergency command center for evacuating people from the stricken resorts and sending in food and other supplies.
Just hours earlier, Austrian soldiers had taken advantage of a break in heavy snowfall to search for victims of yesterday's avalanche in the Alpine town - relieving villagers who dug with bare hands to reach the missing.
