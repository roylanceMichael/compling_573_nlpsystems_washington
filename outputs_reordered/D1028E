Kaczynski, arrested in Montana in April 1996, has pleaded not guilty to the Sacramento charges accusing him of four bomb attacks, in which two people were killed.
Kaczynski, 54, was arrested April 3 at his cabin in Lincoln, Montana, and is being held without bail.
Among those present was Susan Mosser, whose 50-year-old husband, Thomas, was killed when he opened a package containing a bomb on December 10, 1994, in his northern New Jersey home.
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's early victims, which included universities, airlines and other technology-related targets.
The names, addresses and employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on November 12 in Sacramento, California.
