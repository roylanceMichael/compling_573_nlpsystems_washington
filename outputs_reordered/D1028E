Kaczynski's lawyers are seeking a single trial there on all the Unabomber charges.
The names, addresses and employers of jurors and their spouses will be kept secret once the Unabomber murder trial gets under way with jury selection on November 12 in Sacramento, California.
Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer, which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in Sacramento.
He faces a later trial in Newark, New Jersey, on federal charges that he mailed a package bomb that killed advertising executive Thomas Mosser in New Jersey.
Burrell said the length of the trial, which is expected to last up to six months, makes it impractical to pursue alternatives to an anonymous jury, including sequestering jurors or moving the trial to another city.
The judge in the trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of defense requests for revisions in jury selection.
