New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
Ukraine has been in a political crisis since the Nov. 21 presidential election, victory in which has been claimed by both pro-Moscow candidate, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, and pro- Western candidate, opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko.
One notable case occurred in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, when an explosion at a Hoffman-LaRoche chemical plant released a cloud of the herbicide 2,4,5-T, exposing several thousand people to the chemical and an estimated 45 pounds of dioxins, which typically arise as a byproduct in the synthesis of 2,4,5-T.
