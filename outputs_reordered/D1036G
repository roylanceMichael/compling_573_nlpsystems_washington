Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September not suggestive of dioxin
Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a finding on the cause of the illness but said Saturday that tests conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of dioxin
Michael Zimpfer director of the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic that has been treating Yushchenko said tests concluded in the last 24 hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the Ukrainian candidates face
There were high concentrations of dioxin most likely orally administered the doctor told a news conference at the hospital
