Michael Zimpfer, director of the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic that has been treating Yushchenko, said tests concluded in the last 24 hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the Ukrainian candidate's face.
The United States on Monday urged the Ukrainian government to fully investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael Zimpfer, said Saturday.
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic confirmed for the first time that Yushchenko had swallowed relatively large amounts of dioxin.
Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin.
