Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in September, not suggestive of dioxin.
Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin.
Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.
The explosive allegation of attempted murder, now backed by fresh medical evidence, could have an unpredictable effect on a repeat presidential runoff election pitting Yushchenko against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych on Dec. 26.
Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to their effects.
Dioxin is a byproduct of industrial processes such as waste incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
