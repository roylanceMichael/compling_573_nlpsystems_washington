Japan's fisheries agency says the country gobbles up a quarter of the world supply of the five big species: bluefin, southern bluefin, bigeye, yellowfin and albacore.
Representatives, including the commercial fishing industry, government regulators and environmental groups, plan to discuss ways to strengthen information sharing and cooperation among regional organizations to better manage tuna stock and adopt an action plan, the Japanese Fisheries Agency said in a statement.
The statement would be sent to five international tuna conservation bodies, which would hold their first joint meeting in Kobe, Japan, Monday through Friday next week, the officials said.
