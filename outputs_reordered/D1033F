South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for an inquiry into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally taped conversations between the man who is now ambassador to the United States and a Samsung Group executive.
South Korean television and newspapers have released what they called a taped private conversation between ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun and a top official of the country's largest conglomerate Samsung in 1997.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
However, the South Korean president did not mention the fate of the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal, according to the spokesman.
South Korean prosecutors said Thurday they have secured an arrest warrant for a former intelligence official accused of leaking a taped conversation detailing a slush fund payment by the Samsung Group.
