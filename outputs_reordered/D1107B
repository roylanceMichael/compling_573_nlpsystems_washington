The plan, issued by the State Council, or the country's cabinet, said by 2010 the food safety information monitoring network will cover 90 percent of the country.
Ren, chairman of the CPPCC's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Committee in northwest China, said the supervision system should cover the whole process of food production, rather than on the finished food products alone.
Last year China experienced a string of food safety problems including steroid- tainted pork, parasite-infested snails, turbots that contain excessive amount of carcinogens, and ducks that were fed cancer-causing dye to make their egg yolks red.
