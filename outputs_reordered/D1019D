It was however confirmed that among the hostages, there are 11 foreigners -- three Germans, two South Africans, two French nationals, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino while the rest nine are Malaysians comprising four workers of the Wildlife Department, three workers of the Sipadan resort center, a policeman and a staff of Syarikat Borneo Divers.
Eyewitnesses said two of the captives -- James and Mary Murphy, both 51, of Rochester, N.Y. -- escaped after James Murphy told the assailants his wife didn't know how to swim.
