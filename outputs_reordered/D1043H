A successful businessman, a kind benefactor, Hariri was a practicing and observant Sunni Muslim who was at home in Beirut, Saudi Arabia, New York and Paris.
At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with Islamic tradition, joined in the march.
Watching the ceremony from the steps of the mosque, outside the prayer area, were Hariri's two daughters and his sister, who is also a member of Parliament.
