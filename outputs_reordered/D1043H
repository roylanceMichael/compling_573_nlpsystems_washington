It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.
The Lebanese interior minister said on Tuesday that initial indications showed that former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed in a suicide car bombing.
On Monday, Hariri and eight other people were killed in a huge explosion, which occurred as Hariri's motorcade was passing by in the seafront area of the Lebanese capital Beirut.
"Syria as a government and people announces support to sisterly Lebanon during those dangerous situations and offers condolences to Mr. Rafik Hariri and other victims' families," Assad was quoted as saying.
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik Hariri."
