A successful businessman, a kind benefactor, Hariri was a practicing and observant Sunni Muslim who was at home in Beirut, Saudi Arabia, New York and Paris.
At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with Islamic tradition, joined in the march.
Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.
