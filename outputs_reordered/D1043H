A successful businessman, a kind benefactor, Hariri was a practicing and observant Sunni Muslim who was at home in Beirut, Saudi Arabia, New York and Paris.
At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with Islamic tradition, joined in the march.
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut earlier in the day.
Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.
