The EU commission said that 12 other EU states have been alerted after the British scare erupted: Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal and Austria.
The agency has published a full list of the affected items, which are stocked by Britain's main supermarket chains and include ready-made meals such as shepherd's pie, pasta bake, cottage pie, chicken wings, sausage casserole, pizza, steak and kidney pie and chilli con carne.
There are also a number of products made by well-known British food companies, including three flavours of Unilever's top-selling Pot Noodle brand affected: Beef and Tomato, 'The Sizzler' Bacon Flavour and Hot Dog and Ketchup Flavour.
