Rabei Ousmane Sayed Ahmed, an alleged mastermind of the train bombings on March 11, 2004, in Madrid, on Thursday rejected all charges against him.
Police and soldiers will guard crowded areas such as shopping centers, transport hubs and sports complexes, as well as emblematic areas or buildings, the water supply and power plants, the statement said.
He is charged with 191 counts of murder and 1,755 of attempted murder in the Madrid, Spain, bombings on March 11, 2004, though he has been secretly recorded saying that he had not been with the men who carried them out.
