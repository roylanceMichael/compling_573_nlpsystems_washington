Emma, who once carried 150 pounds on her 5-foot-5 athletic frame and was teased about being chunky, succeeded over a year's time in dropping pounds, winning the praise of boys who thought she looked hot and girls who envied her body.
"I started to have more and more mid-life women who had eating disorders,' she explains.
Emma says she realized how sick she was when she began stuffing food down the sofa.
Before she left home for treatment, Emma was feeling guilty that her illness was stressing out her family.
"As long as she wasn't eating them, I didn't see any harm," her mother says.
"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've got a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if I'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds," he said.
