The death toll in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) tsunami disaster has climbed to 599 and is expected to rise, a PNG disaster control officer said Sunday.
Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said in a statement that a community school, government station, Catholic mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of Aitape had been completely destroyed.
The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Defense Force, the police and health services are on standby to help the victims of a tsunami that wiped out several villages, killing scores of people, on PNG's remote north-west coast Friday night.
