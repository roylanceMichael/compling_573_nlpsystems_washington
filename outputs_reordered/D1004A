Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another.
Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on Friday night - 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale in the area.
