The death toll in Papua New Guinea's (PNG) tsunami disaster has climbed to 599 and is expected to rise, a PNG disaster control officer said Sunday.
The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Defense Force, the police and health services are on standby to help the victims of a tsunami that wiped out several villages, killing scores of people, on PNG's remote north-west coast Friday night.
The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast.
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
