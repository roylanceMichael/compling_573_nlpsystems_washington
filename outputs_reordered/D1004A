The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on Friday night - 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the Richter scale in the area.
ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by the Papua New Guinean government.
The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off the coast.
Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on PNG's north-west coast, said the tsunami, that hit the coast west of Aitape on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had almost completely destroyed another, according to an Australian Associated Press report sent Sunday from Aitape.
Australia will provide transport for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea (PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
