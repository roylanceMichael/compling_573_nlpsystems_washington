Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has been found in several provinces including land, factories and others.
After an uncertain response to wide calls for a thorough investigation into the wealth of Soeharto, his family and friends, the dominant Golkar (Functional Group) faction has finally changed its position, saying that it strongly supports the wealth probe.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
