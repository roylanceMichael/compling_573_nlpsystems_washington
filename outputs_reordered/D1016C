Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general.
Chief of the Prosecutor's Office in Irian Jaya Province T.H. Sidabutar said they were also investigating thousands of hectares of land allegedly belonging to Soeharto, his children and cronies.
Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro said last week that the government has started an investigation into the wealth of former government officials, including former President Soeharto and his family.
A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has been found in several provinces including land, factories and others.
Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and cronies during his 32 years in office.
