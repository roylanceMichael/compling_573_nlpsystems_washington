Statoil, which will need a green light from the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority before resuming production, shut down Snorre A on November 28 last year after a gas leak was detected.
Statoil ASA said Tuesday it expects to restart its Snorre A offshore petroleum platform later this week, almost a month after a natural gas leak shut down operations.
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
Meanwhile, Marathon Oil Corp. said production on its Brae Alpha platform in the British portion of the North Sea remained closed after a gas leak there on Saturday forced it to shut down, cutting its 36,000 barrels a day of production.
Bad weather was in part blamed for Statoil ASA being unable to restart 205,000 barrels per day of production from two other fields, Snorre and Vigdis, which were shut down after a Nov. 28 natural gas leak.
