Snorre A, a steel tension-leg platform, was shut down Nov. 28 after a gas leak that resulted in the evacuation of 180 workers.
The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said.
The Snorre field is operated by Statoil, which owns a 14.39 percent share, as well as the Norwegian state-owned group Petoro, ExxonMobil of the United States, Idemitsu Petroleum of Japan, RWE Dea of Germany, Total of France, Amerada Hess of the US and Enterprise Oil of Britain.
Meanwhile, Marathon Oil Corp. said production on its Brae Alpha platform in the British portion of the North Sea remained closed after a gas leak there on Saturday forced it to shut down, cutting its 36,000 barrels a day of production.
