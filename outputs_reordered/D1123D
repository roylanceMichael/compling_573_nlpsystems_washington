The pre-dawn rocket attack, which was aimed at the embassy seal and caused no injuries, bore similarities to strikes by deadly groups such as November 17 and Revolutionary Popular Struggle, or ELA, many of whose members are serving life sentences in prison near Athens.
At the behest of the Greek prime minister, the officer who headed Greece's anti- terrorism squad at the time of November 17's break-up, Stelios Syrros, has been appointed to lead the investigation into the rocket attack on the embassy.
