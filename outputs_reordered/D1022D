Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said in the submission given to the court in January that the government had no right to enforce its law on Japan because Tokyo did not recognise Australia's claim of territorial sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory.
Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
In rejecting the application, Judge James Allsop said Australia does not have a legal right to stop whaling in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction there.
Australia's Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday defended his decision not to intercept whaling boats found in Antarctic waters, saying Japan and many other countries do not recognize Australian territorial claims in Antarctica and a whaling sanctuary that is protected under Australian law.
Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal.
Judge James Allsop based the rejection on a submission to the court by Canberra saying the government cannot legally stop the whaling company hunting in international waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognize Australia's jurisdiction over the waters.
