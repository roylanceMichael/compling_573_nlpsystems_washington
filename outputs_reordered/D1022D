Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo to reconsider its position on whaling, Environment Minister Ian Campbell said.
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
Campbell said he would visit key European players in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) -- including France, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden -- to reinforce Australia's anti-whaling position.
