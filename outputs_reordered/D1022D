Humane Society International was denied permission by Australia's Federal Court last week to sue the Japanese whaling company for allegedly killing hundreds of whales in Antarctic waters the Australian government has declared a whale sanctuary.
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock.
Opponents of the plan have claimed that Japan is seeking to double to 800 the number of minke whales it will slaughter each year, and to add 50 humpback whales and 50 fin whales.
