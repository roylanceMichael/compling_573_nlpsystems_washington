Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said in the submission given to the court in January that the government had no right to enforce its law on Japan because Tokyo did not recognise Australia's claim of territorial sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory.
