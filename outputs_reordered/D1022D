Whaling opponents say Japan is using research as a pretext to continue the commercial sale of whale meat.
Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal.
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales`` ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock.
