Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a small number of countries _ including Japan _ maintain scientific whaling programs in which hundreds of whales are killed each year.
He said he would also discuss the issue with key Pacific nations ahead of an IWC vote at a meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, late next month.
Campbell said he would visit key European players in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) -- including France, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland and Sweden -- to reinforce Australia's anti-whaling position.
The group's director, Michael Kennedy, said he would appeal the decision within the next two weeks.
