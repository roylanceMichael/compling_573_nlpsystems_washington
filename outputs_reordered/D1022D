Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes, and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
Australian Environment Minister Ian Campbell set off Sunday on a diplomatic lobbying mission to Europe and the Pacific as part of a campaign to undermine Japan's push to increase its whale cull.
Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming valuable fish stock.
Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its proposal.
