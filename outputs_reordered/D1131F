In 2004, the nonprofit group Conservation International began a program called the Mesoamerican Reef Tourism Initiative, which aims to address the threat that mass tourism poses to the Mesoamerican Reef by engaging hoteliers, developers, cruise lines, and local governments in Mexico, Belize, and Honduras.
From the South Pacific to the Caribbean, coral reefs- which are among the most delicate of marine ecosystems- are bearing the brunt of climate change and other human-driven activities- including coastal development, deforestation, and unrestricted tourism.
But increasingly, divers and snorkelers are swimming over bleached hunks of coral devastated by shore runoff or overfishing.
