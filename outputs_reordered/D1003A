By the end of 2004, arrow bamboo, the favorite food of giants, had blossomed on 7,420 hectares at the Baishuijiang State Nature Reserve in southern Gansu Province, a major habitat of pandas in China, according to a recent survey conducted by the nature reserve administration.Three giant pandas living in Beijing Zoo will be sent to Wolong of Sichuan Province, southwest China, Wednesday and three others in Sichuan will fly to Beijing Friday, under an exchange program aimed to maintain the biodiversity of the giant panda population.They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County, located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the region over recent years.China has applied to the United Nations to make giant pandas' natural habitat in southwestern Sichuan province a world heritage area to help protect the endangered species, state press reported Tuesday.Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in a separate report.The bank at southwest China's Giant Panda Protection and Research Centre in the Wolong Nature Reserve in Sichuan province will be completed this year, the China Daily said.
