On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a local mountain.
Zhang Kerong, director of the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve, said that the preserve will intervene and help giant pandas find new food source.
Currently, more than 1,500 giant pandas live in the wild in the country, according to a survey by the State Forestry Administration.
A blood bank can also simplify the process of breeding pandas because data on the pandas' blood types and DNA information will be readily available to bring more diversity to the gene pool.
