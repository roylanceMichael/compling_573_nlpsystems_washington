Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and have tangled roots that grow above ground.
The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world.
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment.
Up to half of the world's mangrove swamps have disappeared in the last 20-30 years because of the development of tourist resorts, transport infrastructure and commercial prawn fishing, Cripps said in a telephone interview.
