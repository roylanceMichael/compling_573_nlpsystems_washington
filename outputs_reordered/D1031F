The technology service operation team will also carry out mapping and water exploration, provide water and sanitation management, look for solar energy generated electricity, and conduct studies of the affected areas which could be rebuilt and those where dwelling would practically no longer be possible and should be developed into mangrove forests, said the officials.
To avoid tsunami, people should neither reside in the areas close to coastlines nor destroy mangrove forests that protect tidal waves, he said from the agency's compound in Bandung, West Java.
The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world.
Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
