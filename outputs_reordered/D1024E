Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir launched a diplomatic offensive Friday to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital.
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S. attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _ or medicines as Sudan maintains.
He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility described by U.S. officials.
