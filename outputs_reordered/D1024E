Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the embassy bombings.
U.S. President Clinton said the strikes were ordered to avenge the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and because of reports that more anti-American attacks were being planned.
