The letter, sent to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia, was intended to lodge Sudan's formal complaint that Thursday's U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory were a breach of the U.N. charter and a violation of its sovereignty.
Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
President Omar el-Bashir on Friday recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S. missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest the attack.
