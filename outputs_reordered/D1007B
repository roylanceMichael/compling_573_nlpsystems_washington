Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao.
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
The bird flu in Hong Kong, which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local senior health official said today.
