Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
Former Greco Middle School teacher Debra Lafave, arrested last year amid allegations she had an affair with a student, is scheduled to stand trial in December on two counts of lewd and lascivious battery.
Debra Lafave, 25, whose sensational case made tabloid headlines, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years`` probation.
No matter where she goes, life will not be the same for Debra Lafave.
