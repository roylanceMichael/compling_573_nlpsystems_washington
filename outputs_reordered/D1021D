A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex with the boy in a classroom and at her home.
The agreement was meant to resolve charges against Debra Lafave, 25, in two counties.
LaFave will plead not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid a trial scheduled for next year, according to her attorney.
The arrest is the second in as many years of a female Hillsborough County teacher accused of having sex with a teenage student.
Debra Lafave, 25, whose sensational case made tabloid headlines, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years' probation.
Details of Lafave's past and the student's experiences with her became clearer Tuesday afternoon after the State Attorney's Office released hundreds of pages of documents that could have been aired at trial.
