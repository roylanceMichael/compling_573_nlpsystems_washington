The toxic benzene-contaminated water, flowing down from the upper reaches of Songhua, arrived at the local water supply inlet at about 5 a.m., and has now entered river sections across the city's urban areas, according to the Heilongjiang provincial environment protection bureau.
The 80-kilometer-long (50-mile-long) swathe of chemicals moved downstream into Harbin, a city of 3.8 million people in neighboring Heilongjiang province, on Thursday, prompting officials to shut down water supplies.
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
SEPA has incorporated the pollution-reduction measures China's major rivers, including the Songhua and Huanghe rivers, into the country's eleventh five-year economic and social development program, which means putting the task as one of the country's top concerns, said Zhang.
