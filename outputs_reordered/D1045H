SEPA has incorporated the pollution-reduction measures China's major rivers, including the Songhua and Huanghe rivers, into the country's eleventh five-year economic and social development program, which means putting the task as one of the country's top concerns, said Zhang.
A petrochemical plant blast that occurred two weeks ago spilled large amount of benzene liquids into the Songhua River, resulting in heavy pollution in the section of Harbin, capital of the Heilongjiang province.
The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province, where the river originates.
He said the polluted water in the Songhua River, which reached Heilongjiang provincial capital Harbin on Thursday morning, is expected to flow into the Heilongjiang River (called the Amur River in Russia) on the Sino-Russian border in around 14 days judging from the current flow speed.
