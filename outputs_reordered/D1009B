The Ramseys and their two children were the only people known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder, 18 months ago.
Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a former Boulder police detective on the case and three former friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor, Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey.
A few hours after the dinner, White and Ramsey were searching the basement of the Ramsey house when Ramsey emerged from a room with his daughter's battered body.
White was with John Ramsey when he found JonBenet's battered and strangled body in a basement room of the Ramseys`` Colorado home Dec. 26, 1996.
