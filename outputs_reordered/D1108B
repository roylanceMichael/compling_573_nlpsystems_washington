Tropical Cyclone Sidr, hovering over the Bay of Bengal, was moving towards Bangladesh's southern coastal districts, on the border with India, and likely to hit land later Thursday, said Bazlur Rashid of the Bangladesh weather department.
Much of Bangladesh's south and centre has bunkered down for the storm, with even the country's main sea port at Chittagong, to the east of the cyclone's path, also closed.
