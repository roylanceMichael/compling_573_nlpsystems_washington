Taylor played a key role in the dog fighting operation in May of 2001, federal prosecutors say, by identifying the Surry County property as a suitable location for housing and training the dogs.
A federal grand jury indicted Taylor, Vick and the two others this month on a single count of conspiring to violate three laws: the interstate travel act by crossing state lines to engage in illegal gambling; sponsoring a dog in an animal fighting venture; and buying, transporting and receiving dogs for animal fighting.
- The bad news keeps piling up for Falcons quarterback Michael Vick - one of his co-defendants in the federal dog fighting case pleaded guilty Monday and signed a document alleging the charges against Vick and two others are true.
The indictment says the fights offered purses as high as $26,000 (euro19,000), and that Vick once paid $23,000 (euro17,000) to the owner of two pit bulls that had beaten Bad Newz Kennels dogs.
