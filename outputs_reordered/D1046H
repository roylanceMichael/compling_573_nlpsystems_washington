The aid includes medicines, tents, food, two off-road vehicles, a motor boat, field kitchens, drinking water and helicopter parts.
The destination is Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, according to the China Southern Airlines that operates the cargo flight.
The two batches of relief goods, worth 21.63 million yuan (2.62 million US dollars), are mainly tents, blankets, sheets and food that are badly needed by the people affected by the tsunami.
The Ilyushin-76 cargo plane headed for Medan, the main city on Indonesia's Sumatra island, one of the areas hardest hit by the Dec. 26 tsunami, the ministry said in a statement.
