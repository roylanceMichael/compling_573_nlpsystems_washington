Shortly after the bombings, authorities put New Delhi, India's capital, and Mumbai, the country's financial center, on high alert along with several other cities.
The Hindu holy city of Varanasi was struck by a pair of bombings in March 2006, killing 14, and a blast killed two worshipers in one of the holiest Muslim shrines in Ajmer, also in Rajasthan, last September.
