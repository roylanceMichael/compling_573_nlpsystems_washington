Although geologists said the probability for another eruption is high, they predict it would not be anything like that of 1980.
Interior Secretary Gale Norton, who flew over the mountain Saturday, said the seismic activity has weakened the 1,000 -foot (300-meter) lava dome that began forming in the volcano's crater after the 1980 eruption.
The eruption occurred at 12:03 p.m., when there was a small explosion, followed by the steam and ash cloud that rose from the southern edge of a 1,000 -foot (305-meter) -tall lava dome in the volcano's crater.
Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so.
Scientists said Saturday that they saw more signs of deformation at the south side of the lava dome, a half-mile wide, 925-foot high bulge at the center of the volcano's crater.
