Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles below, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.
Absent such a flow of molten rock, USGS scientists have said it is unlikely that recent increases in seismic activity on Mount St. Helens will result in a significant eruption that could endanger people or property outside the immediate vicinity.
