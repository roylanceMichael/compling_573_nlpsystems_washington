Then, as in the last week, a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the dome, a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the crater, but then the ground quieted without a new eruption.
On May 18, 1980, after weeks of quakes, slides and tremors, of belching smoke, steam and ash, Mount St. Helens, a major peak in the Cascade mountain chain, erupted.
But on Saturday, the earthquakes intensified, and shortly after noon, the volcano emitted a brief burst of steam, which was followed by a continuous, low-frequency tremor that lasted 50 minutes, believed to be caused by the movement of magma, or molten rock, underground.
Sandy McComb, 56, of Portland, Oregon, 60 miles (100 km) south, helped in search and rescue operations after St. Helens' devastating eruption, and she came to see the volcano come back to life this weekend.
