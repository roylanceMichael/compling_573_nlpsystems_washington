Mount St. Helens, the volcano that blew its top with cataclysmic force in 1980, erupted for the first time in 18 years Friday, belching a huge column of white steam and ash after days of rumblings.
A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported.
The eruption occurred at 12:03 p.m., when there was a small explosion, followed by the steam and ash cloud that rose from the southern edge of a 1,000 -foot (305-meter) -tall lava dome in the volcano's crater.
