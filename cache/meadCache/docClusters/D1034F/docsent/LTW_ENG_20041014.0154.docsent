A Third of Amphibian Species Face Extinction, Study Says
</S></HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Amphibians are experiencing a precipitous declineacross the globe, according to the first comprehensive world survey ofthe creatures, which include frogs, toads and salamanders.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='2' SNO='3'>Up to 122species have disappeared since 1980 and another 1,900 are in danger ofgoing extinct.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='3' SNO='4'>The rapid drop -- the equivalent of tens of thousands of years worthof extinctions in just a century -- is being caused by a range offactors that include deforestation, pollution, habitat loss andclimate change, the researchers said.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='4' SNO='5'>But they added that thephenomenon also tells a disturbing tale of broad environmentaldegradation that may ultimately threaten humans and other animals aswell.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='5' SNO='6'>Amphibians are often considered ``canaries in the coal mine''because their permeable skin makes them especially sensitive tochanging environmental conditions.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='6' SNO='7'>``This is the first group being affected by a death by a thousandcuts in the way that we as humans have been affecting the biosphere inthe past fifty or hundred years,'' said Claude Gascon, a scientificadviser to the study who serves as vice president for regionalprograms at Conservation International, an environmental group.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='7' SNO='8'>``It'sentirely possible other groups of biodiversity may go down thedrain.''</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='8' SNO='9'>The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species faceextinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent ofmammal species.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='9' SNO='10'>The three-year, $1.5 million study, which involvedmore than 500 scientists from more than 60 countries, is beingpublished Friday in the journal Science.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='10' SNO='11'>Scientists began noticing the disappearance of amphibians in thelate 1980s and early 1990s, but before this study they'd neverconducted a worldwide assessment of the frogs, toads, salamanders andlegless caecilians, also called rubber eels.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='11' SNO='12'>``We've never documented anything like this for any other species.When species become rare and begin disappearing, we nearly always knowwhy,'' said Simon Stuart, leader of the global assessment team.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='12' SNO='13'>``Thishas taken the scientific world completely by surprise.''</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='13' SNO='14'>Amphibians are under assault for three major reasons, according tothe report.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='14' SNO='15'>Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution andwetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both onland and in water.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='15' SNO='16'>Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicineis a second threat.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='16' SNO='17'>The third is more enigmatic, but it has resultedin catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease calledchytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that areexperiencing drought.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='17' SNO='18'>Surveys showed the amphibian population of Costa Rica's MonteverdeCloud Forest, for example, was stable until 1987.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='18' SNO='19'>The next year itbegan to crash and by 1989, 40 percent of its amphibian species hadgone extinct, including the striking golden toad.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='19' SNO='20'>Stuart said it isnow widely believed chytridiomycosis played a pivotal role in thedevastation, which took place in a dry period.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='20' SNO='21'>The fact that more than 200 amphibian species are showing rapidenigmatic declines is alarming, Stuart said, because it is probablylinked to recent disruptions in rain and storm patterns.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='21' SNO='22'>``This is awake-up call to us that we don't have a grip on the massive climatechange that's going on,'' he said.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='22' SNO='23'>Humans are responsible for amphibians' decline in other regions ofthe world, including China, where many are sought as a delicacy.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='23' SNO='24'>TheChinese giant salamander -- at six feet the largest amphibian in theworld -- sells for at least $300 on the street and makes for severalmeals, and it has now disappeared from nearly all its range.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='24' SNO='25'>In the United States, habitat destruction poses the biggestchallenge.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='25' SNO='26'>Developers and environmentalists are feuding in centralCalifornia over the fate of the California tiger salamander, astriking black animal with yellow spots.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='26' SNO='27'>A casualty of urbanizationand agricultural development, federal officials estimate thesalamander has lost 75 percent of its habitat over time.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='27' SNO='28'>The U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service decided in July to list the salamander asthreatened and identified 383,000 acres of habitat as key to itssurvival.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='28' SNO='29'>Al Donner, an assistant field supervisor in Fish and Wildlife'sSacramento office, said federal officials are trying to ``be sensitiveto the interests of all affected parties'' in the tiger salamandercase, including developers, landowners and environmentalists, ``whileworking to ensure the survival of the species.''</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='29' SNO='30'>Four years ago the federal government launched a national programto research and monitor the state of amphibians in the United States,and it now devotes $4 million a year to identify threats to amphibiansnationwide.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='30' SNO='31'>``We've had a leap in our understanding into the causes ofamphibian decline,'' said Rick Kearney, national coordinator for theU.S.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='31' SNO='32'>Geological Survey's amphibian research and monitoring initiative.``We recognize how there are connections between the decline in waterquality (and availability) and amphibians.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='32' SNO='33'>... Amphibians are a veryimportant indicator of our environmental quality.''</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='33' SNO='34'>But Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University ecologist, said theamphibian study was worrying and showed that administration officialsare ``destroying the working supports of our life system'' byexploiting rather than conserving habitat.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='34' SNO='35'>``They're sawing off thelimb that humanity is sitting on,'' Ehrlich said.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='35' SNO='36'>``Withoutbiodiversity we'd be dead.''</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='36' SNO='37'>Gascon, at Conservation International, said ``there are someactions we can take today to prevent the immediate extinction of manyspecies as we work on a longer term solution.''</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='37' SNO='38'>These include creatingparks and ecological reserves, working to reduce emissions thatcontribute to climate change and breeding animals in captivity inorder to sustain vulnerable species.</S>
