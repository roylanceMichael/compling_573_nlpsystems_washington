	<S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Britain's food watchdog said Thursday three companies were under investigation for their alleged role in a cancer scare that has triggered the country's largest food recall.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='2' SNO='3'>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has launched an unprecedented probe into how a potentially cancer-causing dye contaminated at least 474 products, ranging from ready-made meals to popular sauces, that have been withdrawn from sale.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='3' SNO='4'>It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected products.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='4' SNO='5'>"This has been an enormous undertaking.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='5' SNO='6'>Hundreds of products have been affected in thousands of shops," said David Statham, the FSA's director of enforcement, as the agency added another 146 items to its black list.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='6' SNO='7'>"The vast majority of contaminated foods has now been removed and that provides some reassurance to consumers," he said in a statement.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='7' SNO='8'>"However, there may be some products remaining both in shops and in the catering sector and we will continue to work with local authorities to remove them as far is practical and achievable."</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='8' SNO='9'>Determined to find out how traces of the dye found their way into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='9' SNO='10'>"This is a major investigation," said Statham.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='10' SNO='11'>"Local authorities across the country have visited a number of premises to look at records and take samples," he said.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='11' SNO='12'>An FSA spokesman told AFP that the authorities had inspected three firms allegedly involved in the supply of tainted foods -- Premier Foods, East Anglian Food Ingredients and Unbar Rothon.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='12' SNO='13'>Asked whether any action had been taken with the companies, the spokesman said: "The investigation is ongoing."</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='13' SNO='14'>The agency said in the statement it has advised the local authorities to consider whether to take "enforcement action" based on the evidence gathered.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='14' SNO='15'>Under British law, companies and their executives could face prosecution, unlimited fines and two years in prison, for failure to ensure that food placed on the market is safe and fit for human consumption.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='15' SNO='16'>The five local authorities involved in the investigation are in Essex and Lincolnshire counties and in the towns of South Holland, Rochdale and Basildon.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='16' SNO='17'>The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible items such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of products.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='17' SNO='18'>Despite prompting an increased risk of cancer, the FSA has emphasised that the actual danger is very small given the levels present.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='18' SNO='19'>In Brussels, however, the European Commission expressed concern over the discovery of tainted food and said that other EU states had been alerted.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='19' SNO='20'>Europe-wide rules introduced in June 2003 controlling products like the Sudan 1 dye were not being enforced, the EU executive said.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='20' SNO='21'>"I regret that more than 18 months after the (EU decision) establishing the control regime, certain industrial operators have not faced up to their responsibilities and cleaned up their stocks of raw material," said EU health and consumer protection commissioner Markos Kyprianou.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='21' SNO='22'>"I am concerned that old stocks of chilli from before June 2003 appear still to be used by food processors," he said.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='22' SNO='23'>It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain or elsewhere in the European Union, and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 has to be certified free of the agent.</S>
	<S PAR='2' RSNT='23' SNO='24'>The offending sample is thought to have entered Britain beforehand.</S>
