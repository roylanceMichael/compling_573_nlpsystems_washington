More than half the world's coral reefs endangered: IUCN
More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangeredbecause of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and otherhuman factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
Only about 30 percent of the world's coral reefs are healthy, downfrom 41 percent two years ago, according to a study released Mondaythat lists global warming as the top threat.
But a combination of global warming, pollution,overfishing, diseases and other factors is ravaging reefs worldwide.While Australian and Pacific reefs remain relatively healthy, thereport documents devastating declines elsewhere, including theCaribbean region, where coral cover on many reefs has declined by upto 80 percent.
