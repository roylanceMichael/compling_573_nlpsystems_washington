Years of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman onMaryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if thebusiness will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.
For weeks this fall, even as St. Mary's County celebrated thebeginning of oyster season with festivals and contests, Tucker andAgnes Brown couldn't find oysters.
The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge,Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster,Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials wantto introduce into the bay.
Someofficials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potentialreplacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by diseaseand pollution.
