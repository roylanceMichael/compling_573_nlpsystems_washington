Fear of so-called identity fraud _ said to be the nation'sfastest-growing type of consumer fraud _ is reason enough for somepeople to buy shredders, said Todd W. Henreckson, director of theGeneral Binding Corp.'s Shredmaster division, in Northbrook, Ill.    ``The public's becoming paranoid _ and not in an unreasonablenature _ about their personal identity,'' he said.
Mari Frank, an Orange County attorney who has worked on cases ofidentity theft, summed up the odyssey of fraud victims:    ``First you get victimized by the bad guy, then you getvictimized by the banks that won't believe you, then you getvictimized by the credit reporting agencies that won't take off thefraudulent information and then you are victimized by anothercompany that won't give you credit, then you are victimized bygovernment agencies that won't believe you,'' Frank said.
