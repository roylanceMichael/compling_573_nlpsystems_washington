WASHINGTON (AP) -- The day before one of the men accused of  killing her son was going on trial in Wyoming, the mother of gay college student Matthew Shepard lobbied tearfully for hate-crime laws that could deter future acts of violence.
(AP) -- One of two men arrested in the beating  death of gay college student Matthew Shepard merely watched while the other man pistol-whipped Shepard and left him to die, a defense attorney said Wednesday as jury selection began.
``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as Henderson's trial opened Wednesday.
