``It's important to understand that this is not about health andthis is not about well-being; this is about money and jumping on abandwagon,'' said David Kessler, a former head of the FDA and nowdean of Yale University's medical school.
While the FDA forbids labels that ``state or imply that theproduct can help diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent a disease (forexample, `cures cancer' or `treats arthritis')'' consumers shouldbe wary of products that are marketed as ``miracle cures,''``wonder drugs,'' and ``new breakthroughs,'' according to theagency's website.
