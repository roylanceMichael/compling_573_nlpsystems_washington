But the government opposes an application in Australia's Federal Court to prevent a Japanese whaling company entering the Australian-declared whale sanctuary in Antarctica, which Japan does not recognise.
Japanese media reports have said it will seek nearly to double its annual catch of Minke whales, currently set at 440, in the Antarctic and to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union.
Judge James Allsop based the rejection on a submission to the court by Canberrasaying the government cannot legally stop the whaling company hunting ininternational waters protected by Australia because Japan does not recognizeAustralia's jurisdiction over the waters.
