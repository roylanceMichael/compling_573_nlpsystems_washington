In addition, forecasters warned NASA of the possibility of 150  mph wind on Wednesday.
That came ashore with sustained wind of 85 mph.
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have struck the United States  since record-keeping began, the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which destroyed the railroad connecting the Florida Keys to the mainland and killed 423 people, and Camille in 1969, which killed 256 people along the Gulf Coast and in Virginia.
The center is only 9 feet above sea level, so a storm surge as well as wind could be a problem.
