In a case with possible parallels, a lack of oxygen apparently caused the 1999crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart and four others aboard Stewart'stwin-engined jet.
Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that when the F-16 pilotsflew by the Helios Airways plane a second time, they saw two people apparentlytrying to take control of the Boeing 737.
Though the plane was out of radio contact with the groundfor more than an hour after that, it appeared thatat least some passengers remained conscious.
Hesaid the pilot had mentioned a problem with the plane's air-conditioning system before losing contact.
