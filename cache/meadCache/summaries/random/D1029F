"According to our assessment, based on reports from security officials in the area, up to 30 people died and more than 70 injured," a home ministry official told AFP on condition of anonymity following the clashes.
In one of the blasts, close to the wall of the irrigation department, four people were injured.
"There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence there," Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Yaqub told AFP.
Annan condemned the attack "in the strongest terms", saying it appeared to have targeted civilians, the UN chief's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
