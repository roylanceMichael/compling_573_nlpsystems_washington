If something isn't done soon, it will be too late formany reefs to recover.
Researchers at Florida's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institutionhave discovered that this year's rash of hurricanes scoured damagingseaweed, known scientifically as macroalgae, from coral reefs off theFlorida coast, though they warned it is likely to come back.
It may even be possible that heat-related episodes of coralbleaching, which had been viewed as ominous previews of mass coraldeath to come, could allow these robust algae to spread, leavingcorals better able to survive in a warmer world.
