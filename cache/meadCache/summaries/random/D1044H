Britain's food safety watchdog Thursday added another 146 products to a list of items tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye in the country's largest food recall yet.
"However, there may be some products remaining both in shops and in the catering sector and we will continue to work with local authorities to remove them as far is practical and achievable."
An FSA spokesman told AFP that the authorities had inspected three firms allegedly involved in the supply of tainted foods -- Premier Foods, East Anglian Food Ingredients and Unbar Rothon.
It is not allowed to be added to food in the Europe Union.
