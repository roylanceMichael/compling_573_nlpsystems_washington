During the morning session, Henderson, 21, showed little emotion  and occasionally looked at the pool of possible jurors seated in the courtroom's spectator section.
Authorities said Henderson and McKinney, both high-school  dropouts, posed as homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar last October and then kidnapped and beat him, leaving him lashed to a fence.
Both Henderson and McKinney are accused of first-degree murder,  kidnapping and aggravated robbery in an attack that led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the country.
