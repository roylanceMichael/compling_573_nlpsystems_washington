After 18 years on inactivity, St. Helens roared back to life Fridaywith a giant plume of steam and ash.
Scientists had believed the recent flurry of shallow earthquakes mayreflect movement of magma that came up the volcano's pipe during a1998 swarm of quakes, but Pierson said Saturday's activity suggestedat least some new magma was involved, making a larger explosion morelikely.
That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is risingfrom the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors anderuptions is left over from six years ago.
But lookout points farther away were not consideredto be in danger.
