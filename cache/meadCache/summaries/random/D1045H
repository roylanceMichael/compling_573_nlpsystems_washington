Liu said China was very concerned about possible hazards to Russia and has informed its neighbor several times of the pollution.
On the morning of Nov. 24, the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) elaborated the details of the pollution to the Russian embassy in China, including various test results.
China is now making every effort to strengthen the monitoring and control of water quality of the Songhua River with the hope ofminimizing the possible hazards, Liu said.
The enlarged water current would not only help dilute pollutionin the river, but also slowed down freezing of the river water downstream.
