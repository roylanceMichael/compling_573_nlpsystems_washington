Robert Blake deserves to be convicted of killing his wife, and the actor'scelebrity shouldn't gain him any special treatment, a prosecutor told jurorsWednesday in closing arguments.
Blake killed Bakley, the prosecutor said, when he couldn't find a way to avoidmarrying her or to take custody of their baby.
"Those monsters will never get her," Blake said.
``For a celebrity case, it was tried like a pretty standardcriminal case'' with the defense focusing on reasonable doubt, saidLaurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal lawat Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
