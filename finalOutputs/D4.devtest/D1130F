The ferry, which was built in Japan in 1992, had a capacity of 850 people, but the transport minister earlier said it had 638 people on board based on the manifest.
The ferry was en route from Kumai on Borneo island to the Javanese port city of Semarang when it sank.
The Senopati Nusantara sank quickly after being pounded by heavy waves for more than 10 hours as it neared the end of a two-day journey from the Indonesian section of Borneo island to the country's main island of Java.
